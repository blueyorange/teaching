# Specific Heat Capacity

## Heat Capacity
> The amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of an object by 1$\degree$C.

## Specific Heat Capacity
> The amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of **1kg** of a material by 1$\degree$C.

$$Q = mc \Delta T$$

- $Q$ is heat in joules (J)
- $m$ is mass (kg)
- $c$ is specific heat capacity
