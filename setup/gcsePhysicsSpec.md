## WS1 Development of scientific thinking
### WS1.1 Understand how scientific methods and theories develop over time.

1. Give examples to show how scientific methods and theories have changed over time.
2. Explain, with an example, why new data from experiments or observations led to changes in models or theories.
3. Decide whether or not given data supports a particular theory.

### WS1.2 Use a variety of scientific models

1. Recognise/draw/interpret diagrams.
2. Translate from data to a representation with a model.
Use models in explanations, or match features of a model to the data from experiments or observations that the model describes or explains.
3. Make predictions or calculate quantities based on the model or show its limitations.
4. Give examples of ways in which a model can be tested by observation or experiment.

### WS1.3 Appreciate the power and limitations of science and consider any ethical issues which may arise.

1. Explain why data is needed to answer scientific questions, and why it may be uncertain, incomplete or not available.
2. Outline a simple ethical argument about the rights and wrongs of a new technology.

### WS1.4 Explain everyday and technological applications of science; evaluate associated personal, social, economic and environmental implications; and make decisions based on the evaluation of evidence and arguments.

1. Describe and explain specified examples of the technological applications of science.
2. Describe and evaluate, with the help of data, methods that can be used to tackle problems caused by human impacts on the environment.

### WS1.5 Evaluate risks both in practical science and the wider societal context, including perception of risk in relation to data and consequences.

1. Give examples to show that there are hazards associated with science-based technologies which have to be considered alongside the benefits.
2. Suggest reasons why the perception of risk is often very different from the measured risk (eg voluntary vs imposed risks, familiar vs unfamiliar risks, visible vs invisible hazards).

### WS1.6 Recognise the importance of peer review of results and of communicating results to a range of audiences.

1. Explain that the process of peer review helps to detect false claims and to establish a consensus about which claims should be regarded as valid.
2. Explain that reports of scientific developments in the popular media are not subject to peer review and may be oversimplified, inaccurate or biased.

## 2 Experimental skills and strategies

### WS2.1 Use scientific theories and explanations to develop hypotheses
1. Suggest a hypothesis to explain given observations or data

### WS2.2 Plan experiments or devise procedures to make observations, produce or characterise a substance, test hypotheses, check data or explore phenomena.
1. Describe a practical procedure for a specified purpose.
2. Explain why a given practical procedure is well designed for its specified purpose.
3. Explain the need to manipulate and control variables.
Identify in a given context:
 - the independent variable as the one that is changed or selected by the investigator
 - the dependent variable that is measured for each change in the independent variable
 - control variables and be able to explain why they are kept the same.
4. Apply understanding of apparatus and techniques to suggest a procedure for a specified purpose.

### WS2.3 Apply a knowledge of a range of techniques, instruments, apparatus, and materials to select those appropriate to the experiment.
1. Describe/suggest/select the technique, instrument, apparatus or material that should be used for a particular purpose, and explain why.

### WS2.4 Carry out experiments appropriately having due regard for the correct manipulation of apparatus, the accuracy of measurements and health and safety considerations.
1. Identify the main hazards in specified practical contexts.
2. Suggest methods of reducing the risk of harm in practical contexts.

### WS 2.5 Recognise when to apply a knowledge of sampling techniques to ensure any samples collected are representative.
1. Suggest and describe an appropriate sampling technique in a given context.
