## 3.3.1 Work and conservation of energy

1. work done by a force; the unit **joule** (J)

2. $W = Fx \cos \theta$ for work done by a force

3. the **principle of conservation of energy**

4. energy in different forms; **transfer** and **conservation**

5. transfer of energy is equal to work done.

# Definitions

## Work

> The product of **force** x **distance** moved in the direction of the force.
> $W = Fx \cos \theta$

## Energy

> The capacity to do work.

# Is work done?

If so by which force?

# Is work done?

- Thrust does work **on** the car to increase its **kinetic energy** (**positive** work).
- The car does work **against** frictional forces.

## Principle of conservation of energy

> Energy is never _created_ or _destroyed_, just _converted_ from one form to another.
