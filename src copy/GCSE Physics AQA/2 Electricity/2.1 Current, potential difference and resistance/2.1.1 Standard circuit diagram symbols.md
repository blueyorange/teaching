# Task

## Google: PhET circuit construction kit

1. Go through each circuit symbol, draw and label it in your books.
2. Make a circuit that works, e.g. lights up a bulb.
3. Describe in your books how you think it works. Use words like **current**, **charge**, **electrons**.
4. Make the circuit using the equipment.
