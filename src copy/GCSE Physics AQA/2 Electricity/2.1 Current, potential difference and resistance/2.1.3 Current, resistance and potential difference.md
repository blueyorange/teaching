# <u>Current, resistance and potential difference</u>

### starter (copy and complete)

A 2.0 A current I flows for one minute. How many coulombs of charge Q go past?

$$Q=It$$

<script>
  document.querySelector('#date-time').innerHTML = new Date(Date.now()).toDateString();

# Recap

1. Define 'electric current'.
2. What is the unit of electric **current**?
3. What is the unit of electric **charge**?
4. What is the direction of conventional current?
5. Which direction do electrons move in around a circuit?

## 2.1.3 Current, resistance and potential difference

- what happens to current if p.d. increases?
- what happens to p.d. if resistance increases?
- what happens to current if resistance increases?
- Calculate current, p.d., or resistance using the equation $I = \frac{V}{R}$

- _Required practical activity 3_: Use circuit diagrams to set up and check appropriate circuits to investigate the factors affecting the resistance of electrical circuits.

# Starter

- the birds are at a high voltage
- there is a **potential difference** (voltage) between the birds and the ground
- but the air has a VERY high **resistance** (it is an **insulator**)
- **current** cannot flow

# Quick questions - learning check

$$V=IR$$

1. Three 1.5 V cells power a circuit containing a total resistance of 45 $\Omega$. Calculate the _current_.
2. A current of 30 mA flows through a resistor of 100 $\Omega$. What is the potential difference across the resistor?
3. Calculate the resistance of a lamp which has a p.d. of 3.5 V and a current of 35 mA.

#### Now turn to page 20 of your required practical books and collect the equipment!
