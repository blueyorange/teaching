Divers have to be careful to rise **slowly** or they may suffer from 'decompression sickness'.

<!-- Explain about 'the bends' or decompression sickness -->

# Free divers

- Free divers go very deep without any underwater breathing equipment!
- They do not have any danger of suffering from decompression sickness - why not?

# Recap

- temperature is a measure of the **average kinetic energy** of particles
- particles collide more **frequently** with more **force** when they are at a higher temperature

## This lesson

- What is the relationship between **pressure** and **volume**?

## 3.3.2 Pressure in gases

- Identify the direction in which pressure acts (right angles to wall)
- Use the particle model to explain how increasing the **volume** in which a gas is contained, at constant temperature, can lead to a decrease in **pressure**.
- Calculate using Boyle's law $pV = c$ where $c$ is a constant, or equivalently $p_1V_1 = p_2V_2$

---

# Pressure at a surface

- the force reverses the direction of the particles
- there is an equal and opposite force on the wall (Newton's third law)
- the force or pressure acts at **right angles** (perpendicular) to the surface

# Pressure and volume

- Pressure in gases is caused by collisions of particles with the container surface.
- Volume is the **amount of space** a gas takes up
- As volume increases, pressure decreases, because there are fewer collisions per unit area
- As volume decreases... (complete)

# Boyle's Law Calculations

The product of **pressure** and **volume** at constant temperature for a fixed mass of gas is **constant**.

pressure x volume = **constant**

In symbols:

$$p_1V_1 = p_2V_2$$

- $p$ is pressure in Pa
- $V$ is volume in cubic metres $\text{m}^3$

# Questions

1. State Boyle's law for gases.
2. Sketch a graph to show how the pressure of a gas varies with the volume.
3. A gas at normal atmospheric pressure 100 kPa is compressed to half of its volume. What is the new pressure?
4. What must be kept constant for Boyle's law to be obeyed?
5. If a gas has a volume of 20 $\text{cm}^3$ at a pressure of 400 kPa, what would be the volume at normal atmospheric pressure?

---

# Worked example: Boyle's law

The air in a balloon at 120 kPa is allowed to escape completely so that it reaches atmospheric pressure. The original balloon volume is 0.02 $\text{m}^3$.

What is the new volume?

# Try it yourself!

6. A sample of gas has an initial volume of 500 mL at a pressure of 1 atm. If the pressure is increased to 3 atm while the temperature remains constant, what is the new volume of the gas according to Boyle's law?

7. A balloon has a volume of 2 L at sea level, where the pressure is 1 atm. If the balloon is taken to a high altitude where the pressure is only 0.5 atm, what will be the new volume of the balloon according to Boyle's law, assuming the temperature remains constant?

8. A gas sample has an initial volume of 2.0 L at a pressure of 3.0 atm. If the volume is decreased to 1.0 L while the temperature remains constant, what is the new pressure of the gas according to Boyle's law?

# Review: 3.3.2 Pressure in gases

Can you:

- Identify the direction in which pressure acts (right angles to wall)
- Use the particle model to explain how increasing the **volume** in which a gas is contained, at constant temperature, can lead to a decrease in **pressure**.
- Calculate using Boyle's law $pV = c$ where $c$ is a constant, or equivalently $p_1V_1 = p_2V_2$
