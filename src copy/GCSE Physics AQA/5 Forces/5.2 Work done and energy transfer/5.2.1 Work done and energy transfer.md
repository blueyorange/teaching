# 5 Forces
## 5.2 Work done and energy transfer
### 5.2.1 Work done and energy transfer

# Starter

## Put the title _Work done and Energy Transfer_

When a car is driven at steady speed, chemical energy is turned into thermal energy.

### Write down **three more** situations where there is a _transfer of energy_.

## 5.2.1 Work done and energy transfer


- Identify situations where work is done (a force moves an object through a displacement).
- Use the equation _work done = force x distance_ $W=Fs$
- The joule as the unit of work done (1 newton-metre)
- State that work done against friction can lead to a rise in temperature

# Work

In physics work has a special definition.

> **Force** x **distance** moved **in the direction of the force**

Work is done when:
- **energy** is transferred between stores
- a **force** causes an object to move through a distance

# Is work done?

![bg right](https://digestiblenotes.com/images/physics/alevel/work.png)

The weights are held stationary.

Is work done by the weight?

* no - there is no distance moved

Is work done by the girl?

* no - there is no distance moved

# Is work done?

![bg left fit](https://www.gcsescience.com/forces-moving-car.gif)

- The car is driving forwards at a *steady speed*.
- Consider each force in turn.

* Thrust does work _by_ the car
* The car does work _against_ drag
* The reactive forces do **zero** work - they are at **right angles** to the direction of motion

# Is work done?

- The spring is being *compressed*

* yes - work there is a force applied through a distance

- assume the speed of the ball is not changing.
- is work done by the tension force?
* no - the force is at **right angles** to the direction of motion of the ball

# Is work done?

- what **forces** is the cyclist doing work against?

* work is done _by_ the cyclist
* work is done _against_ gravity and friction

* Work is done on the rider _by_ gravity.
* Work is done _against_ friction.
* Why might different people reach different speeds?

# Calculating work

> work done = force x distance travelled in the direction of the force

$W=Fs$

W = work done in **joules** (J)
F = force in **newtons** (N)
s = distance in **metres** (m)

So, one **joule** equals one **newton-metre**.

# Example: Work done by Yoda

Watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsLb5GNwyNM).

How much work does Yoda do lifting the X-Wing out of the swamp?

- X-Wing mass = 5600 kg
- gravity on Dabobah = 0.9g
- g = 9.8 m
- height raised = 1.4 m

![bg right](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/9/93/Do_or_Do_Not_SWDTPG.png/revision/latest?cb=20190428031515)

---

# Example: Work done by Yoda

force = weight of X-Wing = $mg$ = 5600 x 0.9 x 9.8 = 49392 N

so work done = force x distance = 49392 x 1.4 = 69,000 J

This is an example of **green energy** (lolz).

## Questions
1. Complete the sentences:
_A cyclist going uphill does work against..._
_A zipwire rider does work against..._
_A driving car does work against..._
2. A wooden box is dragged 1 m along the floor with a force of 3 N applied parallel to the floor. How much work is done by (a) the 3 N force (b) the normal reaction force on the box?
3. A 1 kg bag of rice is lifted on the shelf at Tesco through 2m. Calculate the work done.
4. A car drives 200m on a flat road. The weight of the car is 3500 kg. Calculate the work done by the weight of the car.
5. Estimate the work done when you climb one step.
6. How many steps to climb before you work off one Mars bar (230 calories = 962,000 J)?

# Answers

1. A cyclist going uphill does work against **friction**, **gravity**, and **air resistance**. A zipwire rider does work against **friction** and **air resistance**.
2. (a) 3 J (b) 0 J.
3. work done = force x distance
4. 0 J as the weight is at right angles to the disttance.
5. e.g. typical step height = 160mm = 0.16 m. With a body mass of 60kg that's mg x h = 60 x 9.8 x 0.16 = 94 J.
6. 962,000 / 94 = 10,234 steps
