# 6 Waves

## 6.1 Waves in air, fluids, and solids

### 6.1.1 Transverse and longitudinal waves

---

# Starter

## Think - pair - share

## How many different kinds of wave can you think of?

## 6.1.1 Transverse and longitudinal waves

- state the meaning of and give examples of **transverse** and **longitudinal** waves
- compressions and rarefactions in longitudinal waves
- describe evidence that waves travel without the matter travelling

---

# What is a wave?

- Examples of waves include **sound**, **light**, and **water waves**.
- Waves transfer **energy** without tranferring **matter**

## Tranverse waves

The particles move **perpendicular** to the wave **velocity**.

## Longitudinal waves

The particles move in the same direction and opposite direction as the wave **velocity**.

Some people think that in a transverse wave, the particles move 'up and down'. This is wrong because...

# Compressions and Rarefactions

A **compression** is a region of **high pressure**.
A **rarefaction** is a region of **low pressure**.

# Copy and complete

- In a transverse wave, the vibration is ... to the wave ...
- In a longitudinal wave, the vibration is ... to the wave ...
- A compression is a region of ... pressure
- A rarefaction is a region of ... pressure

Now go to **PhET Waves Intro** and play with the simulation.

# Guided investigation Part 1: **water**

1. Are water waves **transverse** or **longitudinal**?
2. How do you know, from the simulation?
3. Describe the effect of adjusting the **frequency**.
4. Describe the effect of adjusting the **amplitude**.
5. Select 'graph'. What happens to the amplitude as the water gets further from the tap?

---

# Guided investigation Part 2: **sound**

1. Is sound a **longitudinal** or a **transverse** wave?
2. Select 'particles'. Describe the motion of the particles.
3. Describe the effect of adjusting the **frequency**.
4. Describe the effect of adjusting the **amplitude**.
5. Select 'graph'. What happens to the amplitude as the water gets further from the tap?
6. Can you measure the speed of sound?
7. What else can you find out?

# Guided investigation Part 3: **light**

1. Is light transverse or longitudinal? Can you tell from the simulation?
2. Describe the effect of changing the frequency.
3. Describe the effect of adjusting the **amplitude**.
4. Select 'graph'. What happens to the amplitude as the light gets further from the source?
5. Can you measure the speed of light? (be careful with units. 1 nm = $10^{-9} \text{ m}$. 1 fm = $10^{-9}\text{ m}$)
6. What else can you find out?

# Summary

- Waves transfer _energy_ without transferring _matter_.
- For example, when waves pass through water, the water does not get deeper at one end and shallower at the other.
- Waves can be _transverse_ or _longitudinal_.
- Transverse waves vibrate at right angles to wave velocity
- Longitudinal waves vibrate parallel/antiparallel to wave velocity.
