## 7.1.2 Magnetic fields


- state what is meant by a magnetic field
- magnets attract magnetic materials
- magnetic field strength weakens with distance
- direction of magnetic field strength in terms of north pole
- describe how to plot the magnetic field pattern of a magnet using a compass
- draw the magnetic field pattern of a bar magnet showing how strength and direction change from one point to another
- explain how the behaviour of a magnetic compass is related to evidence that the core of the Earth must be magnetic.

- son of a bookbinder
- became assistant to Humphrey Davy
- little formal education
- researched electromagnetism, chemistry
- invented first electrical generator
- proposed 'lines of flux' towads end of life

# What do field lines show?

- _direction_ of force acting on a **North pole**
- _strength_ of field by spacing of lines

# Describe how to plot a magnetic field using a plotting compass.

- mark where the compass points on the paper
- move the compass to the marked point
- repeat until you go back to the magnet
- join up the points
- add an arrow pointing from the north pole to the south pole
- repeat for positions (above and below the bar magnet)
