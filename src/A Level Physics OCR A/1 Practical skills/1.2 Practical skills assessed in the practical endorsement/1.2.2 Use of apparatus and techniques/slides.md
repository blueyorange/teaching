## 1.2.2 Use of apparatus and techniques


1. use of appropriate analogue apparatus to record a range of measurements (to include length/ distance, temperature, pressure, force, angles and volume) and to interpolate between scale markings

2. use of appropriate digital instruments, including electrical multimeters, to obtain a range of measurements (to include time, current, voltage, resistance and mass)

3. use of methods to increase accuracy of measurements, such as timing over multiple oscillations, or use of fiducial marker, set square or plumb line

4. use of a stopwatch or light gates for timing

5. use of calipers and micrometers for small
distances, using digital or vernier scales

6. correctly constructing circuits from circuit diagrams using DC power supplies, cells, and a range of circuit components, including those where polarity is important

7. designing, constructing and checking circuits using DC power supplies, cells, and a range of circuit components

8. use of a signal generator and oscilloscope, including volts/division and time-base

9. generating and measuring waves, using microphone and loudspeaker, or ripple tank, or vibration transducer, or microwave/radio wave source

10. use of a laser or light source to investigate characteristics of light, including interference and diffraction

11. use of ICT such as computer modelling, or data logger with a variety of sensors to collect data, or use of software to process data

12. use of ionising radiation, including detectors.
