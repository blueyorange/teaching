# The Metric System and NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter

![bg right](https://www.simscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Mars_Climate_Orbiter_768.jpg)

<!-- A NASA review board found that the problem was in the software controlling the orbiter’s thrusters. The software calculated the force that the thrusters needed to exert in pounds of force. A second piece of code that read this data assumed it was in the metric unit—“newtons per square meter”.

During the design phase, the propulsion engineers at Lockheed Martin in Colorado expressed force in pounds. However, it was standard practice to convert to metric units for space missions. Engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab assumed the conversion had been made. This navigation mishap pushed the spacecraft dangerously close to the planet’s atmosphere where it presumably burned and broke into pieces, killing the mission on a day when engineers had expected to celebrate the craft’s entry into Mars’ orbit.

The contributing factors that led to the disaster, as reported by the Mars Climate Orbiter failure board, were eight-fold. According to NASA’s board, errors were undetected within ground-based computer models of how small thruster firings on the spacecraft were predicted and then carried out on the spacecraft during its interplanetary trip to Mars. Furthermore, the board added that the operational navigation team was not fully informed of the details of the way that Mars Climate Orbiter was pointed in space, as compared to the earlier Mars Global Surveyor mission.

The initial error was made by contractor Lockheed Martin Astronautics in Colorado, which, like the rest of the U.S. launch industry, used English measurements. The contractor, by agreement, was supposed to convert its measurements to metrics. The systems engineering function within the project, whose responsibility was to track and double-check all interconnected aspects of the mission, was not robust enough. The board added that this was exacerbated by the first-time handover of a Mars-bound spacecraft from a group that constructed it and launched it to a new, multi-mission operations team. -->

### So...

# <!-- fit --> Always write a unit!

# Physical quantities

## All physical quantities have a numerical **value** and a **unit**, and often a **symbol**.

## **Example**: A resistor has a resistance of 100 $\Omega$.

R = 100 $\Omega$

* R is the **symbol**. 
* 100 is the **value**
* The unit is $\Omega$, which stands for ohm, the **unit** of electrical resistance.

Note: symbols and units can be upper or lowercase but *must be written correctly*.

# Estimates of physical quantities

## Estimation problems are sometimes called *Fermi* problems, after Enrico Fermi.

## Can you estimate...
* the dimensions of the classroom?
* the dimensions of a person?
* how many people would fit into the classroom?

# More Fermi problems

2) How old are you if you are a million seconds old? A million hours old?  A million days old?

3) Could you fit £1,000,000 worth of £1 coins in your classroom? What about a billion dollars worth of £1 coins?

4) How much money is spent in the school canteen each day? In a week? Over the year?

5) If all the people in Australia joined hands and stretched themselves out in a straight line, how long would it reach?
