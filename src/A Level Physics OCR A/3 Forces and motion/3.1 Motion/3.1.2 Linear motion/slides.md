## 3.1.2 Linear motion


1. i. the equations of motion for constant acceleration in a straight line, including motion of bodies falling in a uniform gravitational field without air resistance. ii. techniques and procedures used to investigate the motion and collisions of objects

2. acceleration g of free fall; techniques and procedures used to determine the acceleration of free fall using trapdoor and electromagnet arrangement or light gates and a timer

3. reaction time and thinking distance; braking distance and stopping distance for a vehicle.
