## 3.4.1 Springs

- tensile and compressive deformation; extension and compression

- Hooke’s law

- force constant k of a spring or wire; $F = kx$

- force-extension (or compression) graphs for springs and wires; techniques and procedures used to investigate force–extension characteristics for arrangements which may include springs, rubber bands, polythene strips

---

# Tensile and compressive deformation

- **tensile deformation** is when a load is applied to cause an **extension** (increase in length)
- **compressive deformation** is when the applied load tends to cause a **shortening** (decrease in length) of a material

# Hooke's law

> A material obeys Hooke's law if the **extension** is proportional to the applied **load** (force).

$$F=kx$$
- F is applied **load** in newtons (N)
- x is **extension** in metres (m)
- k is **spring constant** in $Nm^{-1}$

# Which materials obey Hooke's law?

- **Metal wires** and **springs** obey Hooke's law.
- These materials are called _Hookean_.
- Not all materials obey Hooke's law, for example **rubber** and **polythene**.

# Springs in series and parallel

![bg right fit](https://spark.iop.org/sites/default/files/image/from-left-single-spring-springs-in-series-springs-in-parallel.gif)

## Springs in series
$$\frac{1}{k} = \frac{1}{k_1}+\frac{1}{k_2}$$
## Springs in parallel
$$k = k_1+k_2$$

# Force vs. extension for a spring

![bg right fit](https://i.stack.imgur.com/zhXS3.jpg)

- The **elastic limit** is the point beyond which the spring will *not* return to its original length when the load is removed
- The **limit of proportionality** is the point at which the graph is no longer **linear**
- These points do not _necessarily_ coincide, but are often presented as the same.

---

# Elastic and plastic

## Elastic
> Returns to its original length.

## Plastic
> Does not return to its original length. Undergoes **plastic deformation**. 

- Springs and rubber are very **elastic**, but behave **plastically** beyond the **elastic limit**
- Plastics such as **polythene** have very little elasticity, and permanently deform very easily.

---

# Metal wire/spring

- loading same as unloading up to elastic limit
- wire shows permanent deformation beyond elastic limit

# Rubber

- does not obey Hooke's law
- **elastic** with no permanent deformation
- area X is the energy **dissipated**
- area Y is the work done by the rubber

# Polythene

- polythene behaves **plastically**
- the enclosed area is the work done in **permanently deforming** the material

# Key Questions

## State and explain whether the material obeys Hooke's law.

_No as force is not proportional to extension, because the graph is not a straight line._

# Key Questions

## Describe how to investigate whether a material sample obeys Hooke's law.

* attach sample to clamp stand
* use standard masses/newton meter to measure load
* apply varying load, measure extension each time
* extension is new length - original length
* calculate load = mg
* repeat for increasing loads, then decreasing loads
* obeys Hooke's law if force $\propto$ extension

# Summary

- Hooke's law states that _force is proportional to extension_ for a metal wire or a spring
- beyond elastic limit springs show _permanent deformation_
- springs behave elastically up to elastic limit and plastically beyond elastic limit
- rubber and polythene do not obey Hooke's law
- rubber exhibits _hysteresis_ as the energy released is less than the energy used to stretch. The difference is an increase in _internal energy_ of the rubber band.
