## 3.4.2 Mechanical properties of matter 
### Part 1: Work done is area under graph


1. forceâ€“extension (or compression) graph; work done is area under graph

2. elastic potential energy; $E = \frac{1}{2}Fx$; $E = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$

---

# Conservative force
> A force where the work done by or against the force depends **only** on the start and end points and not on the _path taken_.

Conservative forces result in **stored energy**. Examples are:
- gravitational force
- elastic forces

Doing work *against* gravity results in stored GPE.
Doing work *against* an elastic force results in stored _elastic potential energy_, EPE.

## 3.4.2 Mechanical properties of matter 
### Part 2: Stress, Strain, and the Young modulus

3. stress, strain and ultimate tensile strength

4. Young modulus = tensile stress / tensile strain; $E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}$

---

# Compressive stress

---

# Stress

> The force per unit area. Can be _compressive_ or _tensile_.

$$\sigma = \frac{F}{A}$$

- $\sigma$: stress (Pa)
- $F$: force or load (N)
- $A$: area: $\text{m}^2$

# Question
## Consider two wires, wire P has cross-sectional area A and is subjected to a load F. Wire Q has cross-sectional area 2A. Both wires have the same length.
### What load should wire Q be subjected to for the wires to have the same **extension**?

1. F/2
2. F
3. 2F
4. 4F

# Question
## Consider two wires, wire P has cross-sectional area A and is subjected to a load F. Wire Q has cross-sectional area 2A. Both wires have the same length.
### What load should wire Q be subjected to for the wires to have the same **extension**?
# Solution
Wire Q should be subjected to twice the load, 2F.

# Ultimate stresses

> The **maximum** stress a material can withstand.

Material | Ultimate tensile stress (MPa) | Ultimate Compressive Stress (MPa)
---|---|---
steel | 400-550 | 170-310
copper | 220-430 | approx 220
concrete | 2-4 | 20-60
silicone | 2.4-5.5 | 10-30
bone | 100-120 | approx. 170

## A steel wire of diameter 0.2 mm and length 2 m is subjected to a load of 200 N. Calculate the extension. The YM of steel is 200 GPa.

1. Calculate the cross-sectional area of the wire.

$$A = \pi r^2 = \pi \times (0.2 \times 10^{-3})^2 = 1.26 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m}^2.$$

2. Calculate the extension.

$$E = \frac{FL}{xA}$$
$$200 \times 10^{9} = \frac{200 \times 2}{x \times 1.26 \times 10^{-7}}$$
$$x = 0.016 \text{ m} = 16 \text{ mm}$$
