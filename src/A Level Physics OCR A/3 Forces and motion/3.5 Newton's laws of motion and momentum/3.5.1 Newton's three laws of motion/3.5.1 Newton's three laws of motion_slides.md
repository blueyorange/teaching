## 3.5.1 Newton's three laws of motion

1. Newton’s three laws of motion

2. linear momentum; $p = mv$; vector nature of momentum

3. net force = rate of change of momentum; $F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$

4. impulse of a force; impulse = $F\delta t$

5. impulse is equal to the area under a force–time graph.

# Newton's Laws

1. An object will keep going at the same **velocity** unless acted upon by an external resultant force.
2. The resultant force on an object is equal to the rate of change of its momentum.
3. If body A exerts a force on body B, body B exerts an **equal and opposite** force on body A. Both forces are of the same type.

# Momentum

> Momentum is the product _mass x velocity_

Momentum is a _vector_.

# Conservation of momentum

For a _closed system_, the total momentum is unchanged.
