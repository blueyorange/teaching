## 4.4.4 Stationary waves


1. stationary (standing) waves using microwaves, stretched strings and air columns

2. graphical representations of a stationary wave

3. similarities and the differences between stationary and progressive waves

4. nodes and antinodes

5. stationary wave patterns for a stretched string and air columns in closed and open tubes; techniques and procedures used to determine the speed of sound in air by formation of stationary waves in a resonance tube

6. the idea that the separation between adjacent nodes (or antinodes) is equal to $\lambda/2$, where m is the wavelength of the progressive wave

7. fundamental mode of vibration (1st harmonic); harmonics.
