## 4.5.2 The photoelectric effect


1. photoelectric effect, including a simple experiment to demonstrate this effect; demonstration of the photoelectric effect using, e.g. gold-leaf electroscope and zinc plate

2. a one-to-one interaction between a photon and a surface electron

3. Einsteinâ€™s photoelectric equation $hf = \phi + KE_{max}$

4. work function; threshold frequency

5. the idea that the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons is independent of the intensity of the incident radiation

6. the idea that rate of emission of photoelectrons above the threshold frequency is directly proportional to the intensity of the incident radiation.
