## Learning Objectives

- review electrical quantities and units
- use metaphors to aid understanding
- connect an **ammeter** to a circuit
- use a **multimeter**
- conventional and electron current

# Electric metaphors

:question: Without using any technical language, how would you explain what electricity :zap: is to a five year old?

## think - pair - share

# <!-- fit --> :thinking: :couple: :rainbow:

# Recording data

Always record data in a table if appropriate.

What is good about his table? What could be better?

| Potential Difference | Current / A |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| 1.5 V                | 0.1         |
| 3.0 V                | 0.22        |
| 4.5 V                | 0.29        |

# Practical task 1: **Confirming V=IR**

1. Set up a circuit to measure the current through a resistor with varying potential difference (voltage). :battery:
2. Draw the circuit diagram. :memo:
3. Draw and complete a suitable table for p.d. and current. :memo:
4. Plot a graph of your results. :chart_with_upwards_trend:
5. Draw a **line of best fit**. :straight_ruler:
6. Calculate the gradient.
7. Explain the physical significance of the gradient.

# Practical task 2: **Components in series**

1. Connect three identical resistors **in series**.
2. Measure the current at various points using an ammeter
   :question: Why is the current lower than for a single resistor?
3. Use a voltmeter to measure the voltage across different combinations of resistors.
   :question: Can you calculate the resistance of each resistor, and the combinations?
   :question: How is the voltage being divided? Why?

# Plenary

Think about the metaphors you came up with at the start of the lesson

Would you adjust them, in light of what you have learned?

---

1. electric current as rate of flow of charge; $I=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$

2. the coulomb as the unit of charge

3. the elementary charge e equals $1.6 × 10^{–19}$ C

4. net charge on a particle or an object is quantised and a multiple of e

5. current as the movement of electrons in metals and movement of ions in electrolytes

6. conventional current and electron flow

7. Kirchhoff’s first law; conservation of charge.
