# :writing_hand: Do it now please :smiley:

1. Write 1.4 mA in amperes, in standard form.
2.

# Learning Objectives

1. electric current as rate of flow of charge; $I=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$

2. the coulomb as the unit of charge

3. the elementary charge e equals $1.6 × 10^{–19}$ C

4. net charge on a particle or an object is quantised and a multiple of e

5. current as the movement of electrons in metals and movement of ions in electrolytes

6. conventional current and electron flow

7. Kirchhoff’s first law; conservation of charge.

# Electric charge is **quantised**

- The smallest possible observable charge is the electronic charge $e = 1.60 \times 10^{-19}$ C.
- This was first established by Millikan in 1909.
- It was redefined in 2019 to be precisely $1.602176634×10^{−19}$ C

## :memo: How many electrons are in one coulomb of charge?

# Electric current is a flow of charge

$$I=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} \text{ or } Q=It$$

- $I$ is intensity of current measured in amperes (A)
- $\Delta Q$ is quantity of charge measured in coulombs \(C)
- $\Delta t$ is time measured in seconds (s)
