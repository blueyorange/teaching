# How do electrons move in wires?

- electrons exhibit **random thermal motion**
- **collisions with metal ions** in lattice
- **electric field** within the wire
- causes **net average velocity** in the direction of the potential difference

## Free electron number density

Good conductors have high number densities of electrons.

| material  | number density / m$^{-3}$ |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| copper    | $8.5 \times 10^{28}$      |
| aluminium | $8.4 \times 10^{28}$      |
| water     | $1 \times 10^{18}$        |

## Typical number densities

- **Conductors**: $n\approx 10^{28} \text{ to } 10^{29}$
- **Semiconductors** $n \approx 10^{15}$
- **Insulators** $n < 10^{10}$

# The mean drift velocity formula

$$I=nAev$$

- $I$ is current in _amperes_ (A)
- n is charge carrier number density in m$^{-3}$
- $A$ is cross sectional area in $m^2$
- e is electron charge in _coulombs_ \(C)
- v is mean drift velocity in ms$^{-1}$

# Applying the formula

Calculate the mean drift velocity of a copper wire with a diameter of 1mm carrying a current of 1A.

_The free electron density of copper is $8.5 \times 10^{28}\text{ m}^{-3}$_

<!-- Answer: 0.018 m/s 18 cm/s -->
