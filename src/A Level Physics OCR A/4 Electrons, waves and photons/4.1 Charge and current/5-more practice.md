1. If 0.035pC of charge is transferred via the movement of Al$^{3+}$ ions, how many of these ions must have been transferred in total?
2. If a 50μA current is flowing then how many electrons pass a point each minute to 2 significant figures?
3. In a bolt of lightning, 45nC flows to ground in 25ms. Work out the average number of charge carriers flowing past per second.
4. If $56 \times 10^{16}$ electrons flow to the ground in 0.035μs, work out the average current.

5. How long does it take for a current of 6.0A to deliver $1.5 \times 10^{17}$ Cu$^{2+}$ ions in a solution? Assume these ions are the only charged particles moving.
