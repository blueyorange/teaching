## 4.2.2 E.m.f. and p.d.

1. potential difference (p.d.); the unit volt

2. electromotive force (e.m.f.) of a source such as a cell or a power supply

3. distinction between e.m.f. and p.d. in terms of energy transfer

4. energy transfer; $W = VQ$; $W = EQ$.

5. energy transfer $eV = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ for electrons and other charged particles

# Potential difference

## Definition

> The **work done** or **energy transferred** per **unit charge** between two points.

In equation form:

$$V = \frac{W}{Q}$$

So the **volt** is defined as one **joule** per **coloumb**.

# Example

---

# Electromotive force (EMF)

> The **work done** per **unit charge** to transfer energy **into** a circuit from other forms.

# Examples

- :battery: battery or **cell** chemical :arrow_right: electrical
- a **generator**: mechanical :arrow_right: electrical

A cell with no **internal resistance** has an emf which is equal to its potential difference.

# Kirchoff's second law

The total EMF around any closed loop in a circuit is equal to the total potential difference.
