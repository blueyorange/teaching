1. How is energy stored in the batteries? 
2. This is powered by two 1.5 V AA cells in series â€“ what is the supply voltage?
3. What is the EMF of the supply?
4. What determines how quickly it runs down?
5. How could the design be modified so it runs for longer before batteries need replacing?
6. What determines how much current is drawn from the supply?

# Potential difference

## Definition

> The **work done** or **energy transferred** per **unit charge** between two points.

In equation form:

$$V = \frac{W}{Q}$$

---

# The volt

> The **potential difference** between two points that transfers **one joule** of energy to **one coulomb** of charge.

---

# Electromotive force (EMF)

> The **work done** per **unit charge** to transfer energy **into** a circuit from other forms.

# Examples

- :battery: battery or **cell** chemical :arrow_right: electrical
- a **generator**: mechanical :arrow_right: electrical

A cell with no **internal resistance** has an emf which is equal to its potential difference.

# Distinction between emf and pd in terms of energy transfer

**Both** are energy transferred per unit charge.

- emf involves an energy transfer **into** the circuit
- potential difference is a transfer of electrial energy **out of** the circuit, into other forms.

# How it works

- heated cathode @ low voltage (&approx; 6V)
- :thermometer: **thermionic emission** - electrons gain enough energy to leave surface
- :zap: **potential difference** between cathode and anode > 1000 V (1kV)
- electron accelerates toward anode
- electron beam passes through hole in anode
- **electrical potential energy** (EPE) :arrow_right: **kinetic energy** (KE)

# Example

An electron is accelerated through 1000 V of p.d.

Calculate its final velocity.

$e = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$
$m_e = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg}$


---

### Solution
Use conservation of energy: EPE lost = kinetic energy gained.
$$W = QV = eV = \frac{1}{2}m_ev^2$$
$$
\begin{align}
v &= \sqrt{\frac{2eV}{m_e}} \\
&= \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \times 1000}{9.11 \times 10^{-31}}} \\
& = 1.9 \times 10^{7} \text{ ms}^{-1}
\end{align}
$$
