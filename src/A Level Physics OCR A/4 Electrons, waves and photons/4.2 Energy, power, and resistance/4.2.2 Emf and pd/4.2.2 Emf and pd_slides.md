#### :blue_book: Do It Now :smiley:

Compare the **accuracy** and **precision** of the following two sets of results for the measurement of $e$.

#### Set A
| $e_1$ / $10^{-19}$ C | $e_2$ / $10^{-19}$ C | $e_3$ / $10^{-19}$ C | $\overline{e}$ / $10^{-19}$ C |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.68 | 1.72 | 1.70 | **1.70** | 
#### Set B
| $e_3$ / $10^{-19}$ C | $e_2$ / $10^{-19}$ C | $e_3$ / $10^{-19}$ C | $\overline{e}$ / $10^{-19}$ C |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.49 | 1.71 | 1.60 | **1.60** |

# Solution

- Accuracy is how **close** the measurement is to the **true value**.
- Precision is how **consistent** the results are. 

Set A is more **precise**.
Set B is more **accurate**.

# Potential difference

## Definition

> The **work done** or **energy transferred** per **unit charge** between two points.

In equation form:

$$V = \frac{W}{Q}$$

---

# The volt

> The **potential difference** between two points that transfers **one joule** of energy to **one coulomb** of charge.

---

# Electromotive force (EMF)

> The **work done** per **unit charge** to transfer energy **into** a circuit from other forms.

# Examples

- :battery: battery or **cell** chemical :arrow_right: electrical
- a **generator**: mechanical :arrow_right: electrical

A cell with no **internal resistance** has an emf which is equal to its potential difference.

---

# Distinction between emf and pd in terms of energy transfer

**Both** are energy transferred per unit charge.

- emf involves an energy transfer **into** the circuit
- potential difference is a transfer of electrial energy **out of** the circuit, into other forms.

# The electron gun

---

# How it works

- heated cathode @ low voltage (&approx; 6V)
- :thermometer: **thermionic emission** - electrons gain enough energy to leave surface
- :zap: **potential difference** between cathode and anode > 1000 V (1kV)
- electron accelerates toward anode
- electron beam passes through hole in anode
- **electrical potential energy** (EPE) :arrow_right: **kinetic energy** (KE)

---

# Example

An electron is accelerated through 1000 V of p.d.

Calculate its final velocity.

$e = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$
$m_e = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg}$


---

### Solution
Use conservation of energy: EPE lost = kinetic energy gained.
$$W = QV = eV = \frac{1}{2}m_ev^2$$
$$
\begin{align}
v &= \sqrt{\frac{2eV}{m_e}} \\
&= \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \times 1000}{9.11 \times 10^{-31}}} \\
& = 1.9 \times 10^{7} \text{ ms}^{-1}
\end{align}
$$
