# Potential difference

## Definition

> The **work done** or **energy transferred** per **unit charge** between two points.

In equation form:

$$V = \frac{W}{Q}$$

---

# The volt

> The **potential difference** between two points that transfers **one joule** of energy to **one coulomb** of charge.

---

# Electromotive force (EMF)

> The **work done** per **unit charge** to transfer energy **into** a circuit from other forms.

# Examples

- :battery: battery or **cell** chemical :arrow_right: electrical
- a **generator**: mechanical :arrow_right: electrical

A cell with no **internal resistance** has an emf which is equal to its potential difference.

---

# Distinction between emf and pd in terms of energy transfer

**Both** are energy transferred per unit charge.

- emf involves an energy transfer **into** the circuit
- potential difference is a transfer of electrial energy **out of** the circuit, into other forms.

# The electron gun

# How it works

- heated cathode @ low voltage (&approx; 6V)
- :thermometer: **thermionic emission** - electrons gain enough energy to leave surface (thermal energy exceeds **work function**)
- :zap: **potential difference** between cathode and anode > 1000 V (1kV)
- electron accelerates toward anode
- electron beam passes through hole in anode
- **electrical potential energy** (EPE) :arrow_right: **kinetic energy** (KE)

# Example

An electron is accelerated through 1000 V of p.d.

Calculate its final velocity.

$e = 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$
$m_e = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg}$

---

### Solution

Use conservation of energy: EPE lost = kinetic energy gained.
$$W = QV = eV = \frac{1}{2}m_ev^2$$

$$
\begin{align}
v &= \sqrt{\frac{2eV}{m_e}} \\
&= \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 1.60 \times 10^{-19} \times 1000}{9.11 \times 10^{-31}}} \\
& = 1.9 \times 10^{7} \text{ ms}^{-1}
\end{align}
$$

2. 6 V
3. kg m&sup2; s&#8315;&sup3;A&#8315;&sup1;
4. electrial potential -> kinetic energy
5. $3.2 \times 10^{-16}$; $2.7 \times 10^8 \text{ ms}^{-1}$
6. $\sqrt{\frac{m_p}{m_e}} = 42.8$
7. $0.002c = 7.00 \times 10^5 \text{ ms}^{-1}$

---

# Solutions

1. $W=QV = 3 \times10^{-3} \times 3 = 9 \times 10^{-3}$
2. $V = \frac{W}{Q} = \frac{12}{2} = 6V$
3. One volt is equal to one joule per coloumb $JC^{-1}$. To obtain the joule in base units, you can use $W=Fs=mas$. So 1 joule is 1 $kg(ms^{-2})m=kg m^2s^{-2}$. Dividing that by $C = As$ gives kg m&sup2; s&#8315;&sup3;A&#8315;&sup1;.
4. The electron is in an electric field so has electrical potential energy. As it travels across this field, this is converted into kinetic energy.

---

5. Use $W=QV=eV$. Then equate this to the kinetic energy $W=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ and solve for v.
6. Solving $eV = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ for V we have $v=\sqrt{\frac{2eV}{m}}$. As both particles have the same charge and are accelerated through the same voltage, the only thing that's different is the mass. Divide both expressions and everything else cancels giving $\frac{v_p}{v_e}=\sqrt{\frac{m_p}{m_e}}$. Note that the velocity is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass. The proton is 1800 times larger than the electron, so the answer is approximately $\sqrt{1800}$.

---

7. From the previous result, the proton would be 42.8 times **slower** than the proton, so $0.1c/42.8$.

8. Solution

$$
\begin{align}
eV &= \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\
V &= \frac{\frac{1}{2}mv^2}{e} \\
V & = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \times 3.0 \times 10^8}{1.60 \times 10^{-19}} \\
V &= 260,000 \text{V}
\end{align}
