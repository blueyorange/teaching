# Do It Now :smiley:

1. What are the similarities are differences between the graph for the filament bulb and the semiconductor diode?

# Learning objectives

- draw the symbol for a diode and an LED
- sketch an IV graph for a diode
- state the threshold voltage for a silicon diode
- describe how the resistance of a diode changes with applied p.d.

# The diode

- In **reverse bias** the **resistance** is very **high**
- in **forward bias**, the resistance is high when V < 0.7V, and very **low** when V > 0.7 V
- 0.7 V is called the **threshold voltage**

# Practical task

1. Put the title 'Silicon diode' in your lab books.
2. Set up an appropriate circuit to obtain an IV curve for a silicon diode, and draw in your books (include the **protective resistor**).
3. Record readings in a table. Take more readings around the 0.7 V mark, where the current rapidly changes.
4. Remember to reverse the polarity!
5. Plot a 4-quadrant graph of I vs V
