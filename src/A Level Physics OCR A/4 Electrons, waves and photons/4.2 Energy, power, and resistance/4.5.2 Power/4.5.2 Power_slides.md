# :thinking: Doubling the volts

A 12V lamp has 6V across it. A student measures the **current** through the lamp, and calculates the **power** using P=IV.

:question: What happens to the **current** and the **power** if the voltage is **increased** to 12V?

# Solution

- the **current** will double, as the p.d. has doubled
- the **power** will **quadruple** the original power.

## Why?

- $P=IV$, and _both_ the current and voltage have doubled.

## 4.5.2 Power

## Learning Objectives

1. the equations $P=VI$, $P = I^2R$ and $P = \frac{V^2}{R}$

2. energy transfer W=VIt

3. the kilowatt-hour (kW h) as a unit of energy; calculating the cost of energy.

# What is power?

> Power is the **rate** at which electrical **work** is done in a circuit.

- it is measured in **watts** (W)
- one **watt** is one volt-ampere.

Since power is the rate of work done, work done = power x time.

$W = Pt = IVt$

# Energy transfers in a circuit

- :battery: an **electrochemical cell:**
  - transfers energy **into** the ciruit
  - does work _on_ electrons
- :bulb: A circuit **component**:
  - transfers energy **out of** the circuit
  - work is done _by_ electrons

Due to **conservation of energy**, the power developed by emf **equals** the power **dissipated** by the components.

---

# Equations for electrical power

**power** = **current** x **potential difference** or $P = IV$

by _substituting_ for the definition of resistance we can obtain two more equations.

- $P = I^2R$
- $P= \frac{V^2}{R}$

Choose the correct information based on the information you have!

# Plenary

Three identical resistors X, Y and Z are connected across a battery as shown. The power developed in x is $P_x$. THe power developed in Z is $P_Z$.

What is the ratio $\frac{P_X}{P_Z}$? ![w:300px](./circuit1.drawio.svg)

---

# Plenary: solution

$$\frac{P_X}{P_Z} = \frac{1}{4}$$

- the **resistance** in branch XY will be **double** that of branch Z.
- hence the **current** _through_ X will be **half** the current through Z.
  -the p.d. across X will be **half** that across Z
- so the power of X will be one **quarter** that of Z.
