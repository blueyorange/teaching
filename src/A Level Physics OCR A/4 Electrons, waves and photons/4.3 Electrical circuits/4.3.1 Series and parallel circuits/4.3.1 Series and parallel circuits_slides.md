<!-- _class: objectives -->

# 4.3.1 Series and parallel circuits

1. Kirchhoff’s second law; the conservation of energy

2. Kirchhoff’s first and second laws applied to electrical circuits

5. analysis of circuits with components, including both series and parallel

6. analysis of circuits with more than one source of e.m.f.

# Kirchoff's first law

> The **total** current **entering** a junction is equal to the **total** current **leaving** a junction.

This is due to **conservation of charge**.

---

# Kirchoff's Second Law

> The sum of the **emfs** :battery: around any **closed circuit loop** is equal to the sum of the **potential differences** :bulb: across all other components.

$$\Sigma \epsilon_i = \Sigma V_i$$

This is due to **conservation of energy**, because potential difference is **work done per unit charge**.
