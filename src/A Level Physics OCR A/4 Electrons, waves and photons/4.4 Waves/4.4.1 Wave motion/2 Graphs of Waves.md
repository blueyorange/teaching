# Do It Now!

$$c=3.0 \times 10^8 \text{ ms}^{-1}$$

1. What is meant by a _progressive wave_?
1. Name an example of a transverse wave.
1. Give a similarity and a difference between the properties of transverse and longitudinal waves.
1. Middle C on a piano is tuned to approx. 261 Hz. What is the wavelength, in air, of the sound produced? (Speed of sound = 330 ms$^{-1}$)
1. A microwave ovens produce waves of frequency 2.45 GHz. What is the wavelength of the wave produced?

# 4.4.1 Wave motion

## Lesson 2: Wave Graphs and Phase

- displacement, amplitude, wavelength, period, phase difference, frequency and speed of a wave
- the equation $f = \frac{1}{T}$
- the wave equation $v = f\lambda$
- graphical representations of transverse and longitudinal waves

# Frequency and period

## Period T (s)

> The time for one complete cycle of a wave.

<h2>Frequency f (Hz)</h2>

> Number of cycles of a wave per second.

$$f=\frac{1}{T}$$

---

## Displacement

> The distance in a given direction between a particle on a wave and its equilibrium position.

<script src="/js/wave-motion.js" type="module"></script>

<wave-motion state="stop" height="60" amplitude="20"></wave-motion>

## Amplitude

> The **maximum** displacement of a particle from its equilibrium position.

## Phase and phase difference

Waves can be represented mathematically by a _sinusoidal function_.

<!-- $$y = A\cos(\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}(x-vt))$$

This is not examinable! -->

<wave-motion state="stop" numberofparticles="19"></wave-motion>

- The proportion of a cycle can be given as an _angle_. For the particles at the equilibrium position:
- In degrees: 0&deg;, 90&deg;, 180&deg;,270&deg;,360&deg;.
- In radians: 0, &pi;/2,&pi;,3&pi;/2,2&pi;.

## Phase shift

Phase difference can compare two particles on one wave _or_ two waves.
