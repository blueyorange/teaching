# Do It Now - recap

1. Define wavelength, in terms of phase difference.
2. Which can be polarised, sound or light waves?
3. A sound wave has a wavelength of 0.4 m. What is the phase difference between two particles separated by 0.3 m?
4. A sound wave has a particle oscillating at a **compression**, and a nearby particle at a **rarefaction**. What is the phase difference between them?

When you look into the night sky, you see lots of stars.
Some are brighter, but far away.
Some are dimmer, but closer.

How can we tell which is which?

# Standard candles

This is Henrietta Leavitt.

In 1907, she discovered **cepheid variable** stars.

They pulse at a rate which is related to how bright they are.

Why is this important?

# Intensity

## Learning Objectives

- intensity of a progressive wave $I = \frac{\text{power}}{\text{area}}$
- $Ir^2=$ constant or $I = \frac{I_0}{r^2}$
- relation to the candela

---

# Intensity

> The **radiant power** passing at right angles to a surface **per unit area**.

$$I = \frac{P}{A}$$

- I is intensity in watts per square meter $Wm^{-2}$
- P is power in watts W
- A is surface area in square meters $\text{m}^2$

---

# Example

An incandescent lamp with a current of 0.3 A, p.d. of 12 V is seen from a distance of 3m.

The efficiency of the lamp is 20%.

Calculate

1. The total **radiant** power given out by the lamp.
2. The intensity of the radiation at this distance.

# Inverse-square law of light

> The intensity of light varies _inversely_ with the _square_ of the distance.

$$I=\frac{I_0}{d^2}$$

- $I_0$ is a _constant_ equal to the intensity at 1m.
- I is intensity in watts per meter square

---

### Example

$I_0$ is a constant for that light source. So

$$I d^2 = \text{constant}$$

Or, for two positions

$$I_1d_1^2 = I_2d_2^2$$

The intensity 25 cm from a source of light is 4 $Wm^{-2}$. Calculate the intensity at a distance of (a) 50 cm (b) 80 cm.

# Candela and lux\*

- A candle has a **luminous intensity** of approximately one _candela_.
- The candle appears to get dimmer as we move away - but the **luminous intensity** does not change.
- **Illuminance** (formerly _brightness_) is measured in _lux_.
- $\text{candela} = \frac{\text{lux}}{\text{distance}^2}$

_\*Don't worry about these units too much!_

# Demonstration - inverse square law of light

## Aim

To confirm the inverse-square law using a light intensity sensor, ruler, and light source.

1. Plot a graph of intensity (lux) vs $d^2$.
2. Find the gradient of the line. What does this represent?
3. Find the intercept. What does this represent?
