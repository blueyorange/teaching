# Lesson 4: Polarisation

## Learning Objectives

- Explain why transverse waves can be polarised, but longitudinal waves cannot.
- Describe how to investigate polarisation using visible light and polaroid, or microwaves
- State and apply Malus' law $I = I_0 \cos^2\theta$ and describe how it may be confirmed

---

# Do It Now!

1. Define _intensity_ of light.
2. A 100 candela source of light is viewed at a distance of 5m. Calculate the illuminance in lux.
3. A source of light intensity 3 $\text{Wm}^{-2}$ at a distance of 3m is then viewed from a distance of 7m. Calculate the new intensity.

# Why can't sound waves be polarised?

- Sound waves are longitudinal.
- They **must** vibrate parallel to the direction of the wave (only one possible direction of oscillation)
- Electromagnetic waves are transverse
- They can vibrate in **any** direction, perpendicular to wave velocity.

# An Electromagnetic Wave

- Oscillating **electric and magnetic fields**, in phase, at right angles to each other
- The direction of polarisation is aligned with the E field.

# Polariser

A _polariser_ is used to polarise light. In this example, vertical components are transmitted. Horizontal components are absorbed and reflected.

# Investigating polarisation

- Pass unpolarised light through two sheet of polaroid film.
- Keep the first one fixed
- Rotate the second.
- Observe the intensity go from 50% of the original light, to 0%, every 90 degrees.
- _Alternatively_
  - begin with a source of polarised light. Then you only need one polariser!
  - use _microwaves_. The polariser is a _metal grille_.

# Malus' Law

$$I = I_0 \cos^2\theta$$

- $I$ - intensity of transmitted light
- $I_0$ - intensity of incident light
- $\theta$ - angle between plane of polarisation of incident light and direction of polaroid filter
