### 4.4 Waves

# Recap

1. State the phase difference between two particles on a wave which are out of phase.
2. The wavelength of a wave is 1.60 m. State the shortest distance between two particles that are out of phase.
3. Two particles have a separation of 0.9 m on a wave of wavelength 1.30m. Calculate the phase difference (a) in degrees (b) in radians.

# The principle of superposition

> When two or more waves **overlap**, the resultant **displacement** is equal to the vector sum of the displacements of the individual waves.
