# Recap

1. State the principle of superposition.
2. Sketch two waves that have a phase difference of &pi;/2.
3. Draw their superposed wave.

# Interference

- Raindrops cause **ripples**.
- Overlapping ripples produce an **interference pattern**.
- Why is the pattern not stable?

# Coherence

- To produce a stable pattern, the waves must be _coherent_.
- This means
  - the sources of waves must have a _constant phase difference_
  - the waves must have the _same frequency_.

> **Coherent** sources of waves have the _same frequency_ and a _constant phase difference_.

# Sources of coherent waves

- two dippers in a ripple tank
- two speakers connected to a signal generator generating a single frequency
- a single laser with the light passed through a double slit

---

# Incoherent waves

- Two filament lamps produce _incoherent_ light.
- This is because the filament emits random pulses of light that do not have a constant phase difference.
- The coherence can be improved by passing the waves through a double slit and a filter - but it is still not as good as a laser

# Task

1. Use the [PhET wave interference](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/wave-interference) simulator.
2. Identify the lines of constructive and destructive interference.
3. Investigate what happens to the angles between these lines when you change (a) frequency (b) amplitude (c) separation.
4. Explain your findings to 3.
