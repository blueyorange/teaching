## Question

Two loudspeakers emit sound waves.

Which line in the table gives the correct frequency condition and the correct phase condition for the waves from the loudspeakers to be coherent?

|     |      Frequency condition      |      Phase condition      |
| :-: | :---------------------------: | :-----------------------: |
|  A  |        same frequency         | variable phase difference |
|  B  | constant frequency difference | constant phase difference |
|  C  | constant frequency difference |         in phase          |
|  D  |        same frequency         | constant phase difference |
