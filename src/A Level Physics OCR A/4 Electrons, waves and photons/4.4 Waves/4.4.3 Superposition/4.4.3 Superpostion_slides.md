## 4.4.3 Superposition

1. the principle of superposition of waves; techniques and procedures used to demonstrate the principle of superposition

2. graphical methods to illustrate the principle of superposition

3. interference, coherence, path difference and phase difference

4. constructive interference and destructive interference in terms of path difference and phase difference

5. two-source interference with sound and microwaves

6. Young double-slit experiment using visible light

7. $\lambda = \frac{ax}{D}$ for all waves where $a << D$; techniques and procedures used to determine the wavelength of light using (1) a double-slit, and (2) a diffraction grating.
