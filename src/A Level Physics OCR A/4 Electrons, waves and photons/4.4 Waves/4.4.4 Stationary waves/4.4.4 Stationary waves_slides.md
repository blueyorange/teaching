## 4 Electons, waves and photons

### 4.4 Waves

# Recap

Light of wavelength 550 nm is incident on a diffraction grating of 300 lines per mm. Calculate

1. Slit separation.
2. Angular position of the third order maximum.
3. Number of orders of maxima produced.
4. If the slit to screen distance is 2.0 m, the distance from the center of the interference pattern to the third order maximum.

---

# Recap: answers

1. $3.3 \times 10^{-5}$ m
2. $2.9\degree$
3. $20$
4. Since the angle is small, we can use the small angle approximation $sin\theta \approx \tan\theta$. Then with D as the adjacent we get $2.0 \times \tan 2.9 = 0.10 \text{ m}$

## 4.4.4 Stationary waves

1. stationary (standing) waves using microwaves, stretched strings and air columns

2. graphical representations of a stationary wave

3. similarities and the differences between stationary and progressive waves

4. nodes and antinodes

5. stationary wave patterns for a stretched string and air columns in closed and open tubes; techniques and procedures used to determine the speed of sound in air by formation of stationary waves in a resonance tube

6. the idea that the separation between adjacent nodes (or antinodes) is equal to $\lambda/2$, where m is the wavelength of the progressive wave

7. fundamental mode of vibration (1st harmonic); harmonics.

# Stationary wave

> Stationary waves are formed from the **superposition** of two waves of the same **frequency** and **amplitude** moving in opposite directions.

- They are also called _standing waves_
- Unlike progressive waves, they **store** energy and do not **transfer** it.
- Musical instruments are examples of stationary waves e.g. guitar string, column of air in a flute.

# Demonstration: slinky spring

- Notice that if we vibrate the string at just the correct frequency, we get a stationary wave!

# Nodes and antinodes

- Nodes are points of **destrutive interference**
- Antinodes are points of **constructive interference**

| Characteristic      | Progressive Wave                    | Stationary Wave                  |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Motion of Wave      | Moves through medium from source    | Appears fixed in space           |
| Waveform            | Travels without interference        | Result of interference           |
| Amplitude           | Remains constant                    | Varies spatially                 |
| Nodes and Antinodes | Vary in position as wave propagates | Fixed positions                  |
| Energy Transport    | Transports energy with wave         | Energy oscillates in place       |
| Frequency           | Constant across medium              | Can have multiple frequencies    |
| Formation           | Created by single disturbance       | Result of superposition of waves |
| Examples            | Ripples on water, sound waves       | Guitar strings, organ pipes      |
