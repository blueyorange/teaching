# 4.5.1 Photons

1. the particulate nature (photon model) of electromagnetic radiation

2. photon as a quantum of energy of electromagnetic radiation

3. energy of a photon; $E = hf$ and $E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$

4. the electronvolt (eV) as a unit of energy

5. using LEDs and the equation $eV = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$; Determine the Planck constant using different coloured LEDs.

- Water comes in drops.
- Drops can be **split**.
- The smallest unit of water is a **molecule**

---

# Is matter continuous?

- All matter is made of **atoms**
- Atoms are made of **fundamental particles**
- Many scientists in the 19th Century did not believe in atoms.
- **Albert Einstein** proved atoms exist in 1905.

---

# Is energy continuous?

- Max Planck was investigating the radiation emitted by a light bulb.
- He predicted that it should give of **infinite energy** at high frequencies. This was called the **ultraviolet catastrophe**.
- He obtained the correct prediction when he assumed that electromagnetic waves were **discrete** not **continuous**.

---

# The photon model

- electromagnetic radiation is **quantised**
- it consists of particles called **photons**
- the energy of each photon is given by Planck's formula (below).

$$E=hf = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$$

$E$ is energy in joules, $f$ is frequency in hertz, $h$ is **Planck's constant**.

$h = 6.63 \times 10^-34 \text{ Js}$

# Worked Examples

1. Calculate the energy of a photon of red light of wavelength 650 nm.
2. Calculate the number of photons per second emitted by a 1 mW laser.

# Over to you

Do the Isaac Physics Quantum calculations gameboard.

# Required Practical

## Measuring Planck's constant using LEDs

### Read the instructions and find out:

1. What are the independent, dependent, and control variables?
2. Whaty will you need to record?
3. Will you take repeats?

---

## Carrying out the practical

### Health and safety

> Do not look directly at the LED at full intensity

> LEDs are easily damaged with too much current.
