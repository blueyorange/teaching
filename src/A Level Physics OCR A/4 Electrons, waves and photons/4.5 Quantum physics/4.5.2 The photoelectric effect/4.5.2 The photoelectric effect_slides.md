# A Level Physics OCR A

## 4 Electons, waves and photons

### 4.5 Quantum physics

---

# Recap

Compare two lamps, both 40W output power, one red (650nm) and blue (550 nm) in terms of:

1. Energy of a photon (in eV).
2. Number of photons released per second.
3. What is meant by 'intensity' of a wave?
4. How does the intensity of both lamps compare?

# 4.5.2 The photoelectric effect

1. photoelectric effect, including a simple experiment to demonstrate this effect; demonstration of the photoelectric effect using, e.g. gold-leaf electroscope and zinc plate

2. a one-to-one interaction between a photon and a surface electron

3. Einsteinâ€™s photoelectric equation $hf = \phi + KE_{max}$

4. work function; threshold frequency

5. the idea that the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons is independent of the intensity of the incident radiation

6. the idea that rate of emission of photoelectrons above the threshold frequency is directly proportional to the intensity of the incident radiation.

# The photoelectric effect

## What is it?

> The removal of electrons from a **metal surface** using high frequency electromagnetic radiation.

## Why is it important?

> It is _evidence_ for the _quantisation_ of light, as it cannot be explained using _classical_ physics.

# The gold-leaf electroscope

# Charging the gold-leaf electroscope

When insulating rods are rubbed, they become charged.

- polythene gains a **negative** charge
- acetate gains a **positive** charge

What charge will the electroscope have when charging using **acetate** by **induction**?

---

# Frequency and intensity

Recall that:

- the **frequency** or wavelength of light determines it's colour.
- the **intensity** is the incident power per unit area

With the **wave theory** of light, we would expect the **intensity** to be important in determining whether electrons are released from the metal surface.

---

# Observations

When the electroscope is **negatively** charged, it can be be made to **discharge** by illuminating a zinc plate on the top with ultraviolet light.

- there is a minimum **threshold frequency $f_0$** (maximum threshold wavelength) below which no photoelectric emission occurs
- emission is **instantaneous**
- the **maximum kinetic energy** of the emitted electrons is independent of **intensity**

---

# Explanation

The photoelectric effect _cannot_ be explained using the **wave (classical) model** of light. The **photon model** makes it easy to explain.

- there is a **one-to-one interaction** between electrons and photons.
- electrons near the surface absorb all of the energy of the photon (or nothing)
- electrons do work against the attractive forces to escape. The **minimum** work done is called the **work function** and is characteristic of the metal. Electrons therefore have a **range** of energies, up to some maximum.

# Discussion :thinking:

How is the photoelectric effect similar to

- a coconut shy, and a range of balls of different masses?
- a drinks machine (that only accepts one coin)?
