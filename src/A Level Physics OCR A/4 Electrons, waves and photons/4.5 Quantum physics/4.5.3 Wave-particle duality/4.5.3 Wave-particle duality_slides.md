# A Level Physics OCR A

## 4 Electons, waves and photons

### 4.5 Quantum physics

---

# Starter

Photoelectrons are released when monochromatic light with a photon energy of 4.2 × 10−19 J is incident on a metal surface.

The work function of the surface is 2.4 eV.

What is the maximum speed of the photoelectrons as they leave the surface?

The work function of the surface is 2.4 eV.

What is the maximum speed of the photoelectrons as they leave the surface?

## Ans: $2.8 \times 10^5 m/s $

## 4.5.3 Wave-particle duality

1. electron diffraction, including experimental evidence of this effect

2. diffraction of electrons travelling through a thin slice of polycrystalline graphite by the atoms of graphite and the spacing between the atoms

3. the de Broglie equation $\lambda=\frac{h}{p}$

---

# De Broglie's idea

- light (electromagnetic radiation) was shown to be a **wave**
- but light also comes in **photons**
- matter (e.g. electrons) are **particles**
- could matter particles have _wave_ behaviour?

---

# The de Broglie equation

De Broglie combined Planck'e equation $E=hf$, and Einstein's equation $E=mc^2$ to come up with a relationship for the wavelength of a particle.

> The wavelength of a particle is inversely proportional to it's momentum.

$$\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{h}{mv}$$

$\lambda$ is called the _de Broglie wavelength_.

---

# Example

$$\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{h}{mv}$$

Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of

1. An electron ($m_e=9.11\times10^{-31} \text{ kg}$) travelling at $1 \times 10^6$ ms$^{-1}$.
2. A car 1000 kg travelling at 30 ms$^{-1}$
3. A proton ($m_p=1.67\times10^{-27} \text{ kg}$) travelling at $1 \times 10^6$ ms$^{-1}$.

Which of these will have observable diffraction effects when passed through a crystal of spacing 0.1 nm?

---

# Evidence for electrons behaving like waves

We will look at:

- electron diffraction (the main one)
- double slit interference using electrons

---

# Electron diffraction

- electrons accelerated through a high p.d.
- strike a thin piece of polycrystalline graphite
- interference pattern observed on fluorescent screen (concentric rings)
- ring spacing decreases if accelerating voltage (electron speed) increases

---

# Two source interference of electrons
