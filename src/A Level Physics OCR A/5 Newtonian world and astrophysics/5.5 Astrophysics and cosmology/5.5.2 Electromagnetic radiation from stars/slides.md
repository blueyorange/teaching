## 5.5.2 Electromagnetic radiation from stars


1. energy levels of electrons in isolated gas atoms

2. the idea that energy levels have negative values

3. emission spectral lines from hot gases in terms of emission of photons and transition of electrons between discrete energy levels

4. the equations $hf=\Delta E$ and $\frac{hc}{\lambda}=\Delta E$

5. different atoms have different spectral lines which can be used to identify elements within stars

6. continuous spectrum, emission line spectrum and absorption line spectrum

7. transmission diffraction grating used to determine the wavelength of light

8. the condition for maxima $d \sin \theta = n\lambda$, where d is the grating spacing

9. use of Wienâ€™s displacement $\lambda_max \propto \frac{1}{T}$ to estimate the peak surface temperature (of a star)

10. luminosity L of a star; Stefan's law $L=4\pi^2\sigma T^4$ where $\sigma$ is the Stefan constant

11. use of Wien's displacement law and Stefan's law to estimate the radius of a star
