## 5.5.3 Cosmology


1. distances measured in astronomical unit (AU), light-year (ly) and parsec (pc)

2. stellar parallax; distances the parsec (pc)

3. the equation $p=\frac{1}{d}$ where p is the parallax in seconds of an arc and d is the distance in parsec

4. the Cosmological principle; universe is homogeneous, isotropic and the laws of physics are universal

5. Doppler effect; Doppler shift of electromagnetic radiation

6. Doppler equation $\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda} \approx \frac{\Delta f}{f} \approx \frac{v}{c}$

7. Hubble's law; $v \approx H_0 d$ for receding galaxies, where $H_0$ is the Hubble constant

8. model of an expanding universe supported by galactic red shift

9. Hubble constant $H_0$ in both km s<sup>–1</sup> Mpc<sup>–1</sup> and s<sup>–1</sup> units

10. the Big Bang theory

11. experimental evidence for the Big Bang theory from microwave background radiation at a temperature of 2.7 K

12. the idea that the Big Bang gave rise to the expansion of space-time

13. estimation for the age of the universe; $t \approx H_0^{-1}$

14. evolution of the universe after the Big Bang to the present

15. current ideas; universe is made up of dark energy, dark matter, and a small percentage of ordinary matter.
