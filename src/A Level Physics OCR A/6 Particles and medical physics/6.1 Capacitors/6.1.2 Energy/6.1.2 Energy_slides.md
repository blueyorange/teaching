### 6.1 Capacitors

---

# Do It Now Please :pen:

1. A capacitor is charged at at constant current of 2$\mu$A for 10s. The final voltage is 3.2 V. What is the capacitance.
2. An electron is moved from one capacitor plate to another, during which the p.d. is 3V. Calculate the work done by the cell to move the electron.
3. :thinking: In terms of energy storage, what does charging a capacitor have to do with stretching a spring?
4. A capacitor charged to 2V stores 2J of energy. How much energy would a capacitor charged to 4V store?

## 6.1.2 Energy in Capacitors :zap:

1. p.d. – charge graph for a capacitor; energy stored is area under graph

2. energy stored $W=\frac{1}{2}QV$; $W=\frac{1}{2}\frac{Q^2}{C}$ and $W=\frac{1}{2}V^2C$

3. uses of capacitors as storage of energy

# Capacitors store **energy**

Capacitors can be **charged** by a cell and **discharged**.

This energy can be used to different purposes.

Can you think of/recall any examples?

# Energy stored

Last lesson we charged a capacitor with constant current. We could obtain a graph like so:

How could we calculate the energy stored in this capacitor?

# Energy stored is **area under QV graph**

![](http://physicsnet.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/cap-energy-graph.jpg)

This fact is used to derive $W=\frac{1}{2}QV$; $W=\frac{1}{2}\frac{Q^2}{C}$ and $W=\frac{1}{2}V^2C$

## Answer the summary questions 21.3

### Additional questions

6. A 100$\mu$F capacitor discharges from 6.0V to 2.0 V. Calculate:

- the charge lost
- the energy lost

7. The energy stored by a capacitor is always half the work done by the cell to charge it. Where does the rest of the energy go?

8. The 100 $\mu$F capacitor is charged to 6V and discharged into a second 100 $\mu$ F capacitor. What is the final P.d and energy stored?

#### What is the energy transferred to the capacitor?

A $5.0 \times 10^{-3}$ J
B $1.0 \times 10^{-2}$ J
C $2.0 \times 10^{-2}$ J
