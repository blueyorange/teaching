### 6.1 Capacitors

---

# Do It Now Please :pen:

1. A capacitor is charged at at constant current of 2$\mu$A for 10s. The final voltage is 3.2 V. What is the capacitance.
2. An electron is moved from one capacitor plate to another, during which the p.d. is 3V. Calculate the work done by the cell to move the electron.
3. :thinking: In terms of energy storage, what does charging a capacitor have to do with stretching a spring?
4. A capacitor charged to 2V stores 2J of energy. How much energy would a capacitor charged to 4V store?

## 6.1.2 Energy in Capacitors :zap:

1. p.d. â€“ charge graph for a capacitor; energy stored is area under graph

2. energy stored $W=\frac{1}{2}QV$; $W=\frac{1}{2}\frac{Q^2}{C}$ and $W=\frac{1}{2}V^2C$

3. uses of capacitors as storage of energy

# Capacitors store **energy**

Capacitors can be **charged** by a cell and **discharged**.

This energy can be used to different purposes.

Can you think of/recall any examples?

# Energy stored

Last lesson we charged a capacitor with constant current. We could obtain a graph like so:

How could we calculate the energy stored in this capacitor?

# Energy stored is **area under QV graph**

![](http://physicsnet.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/cap-energy-graph.jpg)

This fact is used to derive $W=\frac{1}{2}QV$; $W=\frac{1}{2}\frac{Q^2}{C}$ and $W=\frac{1}{2}V^2C$
