# :memo: Just do it

Concentrate on clarity of working (show correct equation etc.)

1. A 1000 &mu;F capacitor stores 1000 &mu;C of charge. How much energy does it store?
2. A capacitor is charged by constant current of 20 mA for 10s. It reaches 5V. How much energy is stored?
3. A 470 &mu;F capacitor is charged to 6V. How much energy does it store?

# Solutions

Choose the correct equation!

1. $W=\frac{Q^2}{2C}$
2. $W=\frac{1}{2}QV$
3. $W=\frac{1}{2}CV^2$

## 6.1.3 Discharging capacitors

1. charging and discharging capacitor through a resistor; techniques and procedures to investigate the charge and the discharge of a capacitor using both meters and data-loggers

2. time constant of a capacitorâ€“resistor circuit; $\tau=CR$

3. equations of the form $x=x_0 e^{-\frac{t}{CR}}$ and $x=x_0(1-e^{-\frac{t}{CR}})$
