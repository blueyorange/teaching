# Do it now!

1. How much charge passes a point when a current of 8A flows for 5s?
2. How many electrons pass this point in this time?
3. In school you were taught that current cannot flow if a circuit is incomplete. Is this true?
4. Draw a circuit diagram including a cell and a resistor. Show the direction of conventional current and the sign of the charge on each side of the cell.

# What is a capacitor?

A capacitor is an electrical component which stores **energy** through the separation of **electric charge**.

## Uses

- timing
- energy storage (e.g. camera flash)
- smoothing circuits (a.c. -> d.c.)
- radio tuning
- frequency filters

# Demonstration: super capacitor!

- We can make a rudimentary capacitor using **aluminium foil** and a **polythene sheet**!

## Key points

- A capacitor is like a sandwich :sandwich:: two pieces of conducting material :bread: separated by a **dielectric** (insulator).
- :exclamation: current is **not** supposed to flow through the dielectric
- **high voltages** cause the capacitor to **break down** and current to flow thorugh it

# Capacitance

## A measure of how much **charge** a capacitor can hold for a given **potential difference** (p.d.)

$$C = \frac{Q}{V}$$

$C$ - capacitance, measured in farads (F)

1 farad is quite a large capacitance. They are typically measured in pF, nF, or ÂµF.

---

# Charging

- Current will flow **until** the p.d. matches the cell p.d.

---

# Discharging

Current flows until the p.d. is zero.

---

# Practical task: charging and discharging

1. Set up a circuit to charge and discharge the capacitor. You can use a **three way switch**. Draw this circuit.
2. Include an ammeter and voltmeter.
3. Practice charging and discharging. Notice what happens to the p.d. and current when you charge and discharge.
4. Try changing the resistor and the capacitor.

---

# Feedback

- What did you find out?
- Why do you think this is?

---

# Key points

- bigger capacitors discharge more slowly because they hold more charge
- the initial current depends only on the resistance and p.d. of the cell
- current and the rate of change of current decrease with time for both charging and discharging
- the rate of change of p.d. decreases with time

---

# Questions

1. Define capacitance.
2. Define the farad.
3. Describe what happens during the process of charging a capacitor.
4. Explain why the current reduces with time, by referring to the p.d. in the circuit.
5. Sketch a graph of p.d. and current against time for charging and discharging (four graphs).
