# 9.1 Discharging a capacitor

## Aims

- Measure and record values of potential difference for a **discharging** capacitor
- Plot graphs of
  - potential difference against time
  - ln(V) against time

| CPAC | How to obtain |
|---|---|
| 1 Follows written instructions | Ensure you have thoroughly read and are carrying out all instructions |
| 2 Applies investigative approaches and methods | Independently tackles any issues encoutered; uses a spreadsheet/datalogger to process results |
| 3 Safely uses a range of equipment | No capacitors damaged! |
| 4 Makes and records observations | Results are entered **immediately** into lab books in a **ruled table** |
| 5 Researches and reports | :x: |

# Choosing your resistor

- you will use a 1000 &mu;F capacitor.
- capacitor is fully discharged after 5CR
- take readings for two minutes max
- use this to choose your capacitor from a

Set up a circuit for quickly charging a capacitor from a cell and discharging through a fixed resistor. **Draw this into your lab books.**

## Method - discharging

1. Choose an appropriate starting voltage.
2. Charge and then discharge the capacitor and examine how long it takes to discharge. Decide on a suitable interval to take your measurements of p.d., bearing in mind you will need to take >10 readings.
3. Charge the capacitor. Flick the switch to begin discharging and start the stopclock. Take a measurement of voltage at your chosen interval.
4. Repeat step 3 two more times.
5. Calculate the mean p.d. and plot graphs of V vs t and ln V vs t.

# Analysis

1. Use the graph of V vs t to find the time constant, and hence the capacitance.
2. Use the graph of $\ln{V}$ vs $t$ to find the time constant and to get another value of capacitance.
3. Identify the meaning of the intercept.

$$\begin{align}
V &= V_0e^{-\frac{t}{CR}} \\
\ln V &= \ln{(V_0e^{-\frac{t}{CR}})} \\
\ln V &=\ln V_0 - \frac{1}{CR} t \\
\end{align}
$$

# Evaluation

- Do your values agree?
- What is the % error in your value(s) for capacitance?
- What could be the reason for this?

---

# Prep

- Take a photo of your results table.
- Use excel to process your data and plot the straight line graph.
- Print this out so that it can be stuck into your lab books as evidence.
