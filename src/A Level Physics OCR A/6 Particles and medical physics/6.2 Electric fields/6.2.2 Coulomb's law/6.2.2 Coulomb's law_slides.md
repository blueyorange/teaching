## 6.2.2 Coulomb's law

1. Coulomb's law; $F=\frac{Qq}{4\pi \epsilon _0 r^2}$

2. electric field strength $E=\frac{Q}{4\pi \epsilon _0 r^2}$ for a point charge

3. similarities and differences between the gravitational field of a point mass and the electric field of a point charge

4. the concept of electric fields as being one of a number of forms of field giving rise to a force
