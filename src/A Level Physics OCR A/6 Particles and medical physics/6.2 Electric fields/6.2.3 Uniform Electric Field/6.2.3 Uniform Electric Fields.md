# 6.2.3 Uniform Electric Field Strength

- uniform electric field strength $E = \frac{V}{d}$
- parallel plate capacitor; permittivity $C = \frac{\epsilon_0 A}{d}$ $C=\frac{\epsilon A}{d}$; $\epsilon = \epsilon_r \epsilon_0$
- motion of charged particles in a uniform electric field

# Uniform electric field

- a **uniform** field has a **constant** field strength
- the field between **charged parallel plates** is approximately uniform
