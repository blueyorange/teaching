# Deflection tube

- electrons created by **thermionic emission** of **cathode**, p.d. &approx; 6V
- are **accelerated** towards **anode** through a **high p.d.** &approx; kV
- hole in anode allows **horizontal beam** of electrons
- parallel plates cause **vertical** electric field
- trajectory of electrons appears on **fluorescent screen**

# Questions

1. Describe the motion of a charged particle in a uniform electric field.
2. An electron is released from rest in a uniform electric field of magnitude 500 V/m. Calculate the time it takes for the electron to reach a vertical displacement of 0.1 m.
3. A charged particle with a charge of +3.2 × 10^-6 C and a mass of 4.0 × 10^-4 kg is projected horizontally with a velocity of 50 m/s into a uniform electric field of magnitude 200 N/C vertically upward. Determine the acceleration of the particle and the vertical displacement after 2 seconds.

---

# Answers

1. constant velocity perpendicular to the field; constant acceleration parallel to the field; parabolic trajectory overall.
2. To find acceleration we need $a = \frac{eE}{m} = 8.78 \times 10^{13} \text{ ms}^{-2}$. Then using $s=\frac{1}{2}at^2$, $t = \sqrt{2s/a} = 48 \text{ ns}$.
3. $a = 1.6 \text{ ms}^{-2}$; $s=3 \text{ m}$

# Plenary

Two parallel metal plates are separated by a distance d and have a potential difference V across them. Which expression gives the magnitude of the electrostatic force acting on a charge Q placed midway between the plates?

- $\frac{2Vq}{d}$
- $\frac{VQ}{d}$
- $\frac{VQ}{2d}$
- $\frac{Qd}{V}$

---

## Answer to plenary

The answer is $\frac{Vq}{d}$, from the combination of the formulas $E=V/d$ and $F=qE$.
