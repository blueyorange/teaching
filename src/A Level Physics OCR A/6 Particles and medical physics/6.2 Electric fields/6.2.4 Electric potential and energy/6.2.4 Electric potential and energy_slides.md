# Do It Now! :sunglasses:

1. What is the definition of electric field strength?
2. Give the unit of electric field strength.
3. How can we find the electric field strength in a uniform field, if we know the p.d. between the plates and their separation?
4. State the value of an electronvolt (eV) in joules
5. How does the field vary with distance from a point charge?

# 6.2.4 Electric potential and energy

1. electric potential at a point as the work done in bringing unit positive charge from infinity to the point; electric potential is zero at infinity
2. force-distance graph for a point or spherical charge; work done is area under graph
3. electric potential $V=\frac{Q}{4\pi \epsilon _0 r}$
4. capacitance $C=4\pi \epsilon _0 R$ for an isolated sphere
5. electric potential energy $W = \frac{Qq}{4\pi \epsilon _0 r}$ a distance $r$ from a point charge $Q$

# Electric potential **difference**

The electric potential difference between two points is equal to the **work done per unit charge**.

This is why one **volt** is equal to one **joule per coulomb**.

$$\Delta V = \frac{\Delta W}{Q}$$

---

# Definition of electric **potential**

> The **electric potential** at a **point** is the work done to bring a unit **positive** charge from &infin; to that point.

Potential is a **scalar**, and is measured in **volts**.

---

# The sign of potential

From this definition, it follows that:

- potential at &infin; is _zero_
- the potential around positive charge is _positive_
- the potential around a negative charge is _negative_

# Potential in a radial field

So, _integrating_ from &infin; to a point r distance from a charge Q gives us the _potential_ of charge Q.

We find that potential _V_ varies **inversely** with distance _r_ from the center of a charged sphere _Q_.

$$V = \frac{Q}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r}$$

This looks very similar to the equation for field strength, but they have very different meanings.

---

# Capacitance of a charged sphere in vacuum

Since $C = \frac{Q}{V}$ and $V = \frac{Q}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r}$, we get:

$$C = 4\pi \epsilon_0 R$$

Notice that it only depends on the sphere's **radius**.

---

# Potential _energy_ of a charge in a radial field

A test charge $q$ in the field of another charge $Q$ has a potential energy given by:

$$W = \frac{Qq}{4\pi \epsilon _0 r}$$

Notice that $W = qV$.

---

# Worked example: electric potential

A charge of +2.0 nC moves from a distance of 73 cm to a distance of 40cm away from a **fixed charge** of -10nC.

Calculate the **work done** on the charge, and state its sign.
