## 6.2.4 Electric potential and energy

1. electric potential at a point as the work done in bringing unit positive charge from infinity to the point; electric potential is zero at infinity
4. force-distance graph for a point or spherical charge; work done is area under graph
2. electric potential $V=\frac{Q}{4\pi \epsilon _0 r}$
3. capacitance $C=4\pi \epsilon _0 R$ for an isolated sphere
5. electric potential energy $V = \frac{Q}{4\pi \epsilon _0 r}$ a distance $r$ from a point charge $Q$

# Electric potential **difference**

The electric potential difference between two points is equal to the **work done per unit charge**.

This is why one **volt** is equal to one **joule per coulomb**.

$$\Delta V = \frac{\Delta W}{Q}$$

# Definition of electric **potential**

> The electric potential at a **point** is the work done to bring a unit **positive** charge from &infin; to that point.

Potential is a **scalar**.

# The sign of potential

- potential is
  - **positive** around positive charge
  - **negative** around negative charge
  - **zero** at infinity

# Force-distance graph

# Potential in a radial field

Potential *V* varies **inversely** with distance *r* from the center of a charged sphere *Q*.

$$V = \frac{Q}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r}$$
