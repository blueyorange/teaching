# 6.4.1 The nucleus

- proton number; nucleon number; isotopes; notation $^A_ZX$
- electron diffraction
- strong nuclear force; short-range nature of the force; attractive to about 3 fm and repulsive below about 0.5 fm

---

# Nuclide Notation

$$^A_ZX$$

- A is the **mass number**, equal to the total number of **nucleons** (protons and neutrons)
- Z is the **astomic number**, equal to the number of **protons** in the nucleus.

---

# Isotopes

## Isotope

> A nuclide with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons.

- Isotopes are chemically identical, but have a different mass.

---

# Nuclear Radius

There are two ways we can measure nuclear radius:

- closest approach (Rutherford scattering)
- electron diffraction

Which is better?

---

# Single slit diffraction
