## 6.4.1 The nuclear atom


- alpha-particle scattering experiment; evidence of a small charged nucleus

- simple nuclear model of the atom; protons, neutrons and electrons

- relative sizes of atom and nucleus

> It was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life. It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you. On consideration, I realized that this scattering backward must be the result of a single collision, and when I made calculations I saw that it was impossible to get anything of that order of magnitude unless you took a system in which the greater part of the mass of the atom was **concentrated in a minute nucleus**. It was then that I had the idea of an atom with a **minute massive centre**, carrying a [positive] **charge**.

# Observations and conclusions

| Observation      | Conclusion |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Most alpha particles pass through undeflected | The atom is mostly empty space       |
| About 1 in 10,000 alpha particles are deflected through large angles   | There is a small, dense, positively charged nucleus.|

# Task

Using the PhET simulation, annotate your diagram. Identify the similarities and differences between the expectations of the plum pudding model and the actual observations.

# Elastic collisions

- Rutherford used alpha particles of about 7.7 MeV
- Rutherford concluded that the nucleus is about $10^{-14}$ m in diameter
- The actual typical radius is about $10^{-15}$ m.

## How could he have achieved a more accurate result?
