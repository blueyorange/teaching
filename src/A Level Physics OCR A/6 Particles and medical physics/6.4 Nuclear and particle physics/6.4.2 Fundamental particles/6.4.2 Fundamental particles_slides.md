## 6.4.2 Fundamental particles
### Part 1: particles and antiparticles

1. particles and antiparticles; electron–positron, proton-antiproton, neutron-antineutron and neutrino-antineutrino

2. particle and its corresponding antiparticle have same mass; electron and positron have opposite charge; proton and antiproton have opposite charge

3. classification of hadrons; proton and neutron as examples of hadrons; all hadrons are subject to both the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force

4. classification of leptons; electron and neutrino as examples of leptons; all leptons are subject to the weak nuclear force but not the strong nuclear force

5. simple quark model of hadrons in terms of up, down and strange quarks and their respective anti-quarks

6. quark model of the proton (uud) and the neutron (udd)

7. charges of the up (u), down (d), strange (s), anti-up (u), anti-down (d) and the anti-strange (s) quarks as fractions of the elementary charge e
8. beta-minus (β-) decay; beta-plus (β+) decay

9. β- decay in terms of a quark model

10. β+ decay in terms of a quark model

11. balancing of quark transformation equations in
terms of charge

12. decay of particles in terms of the quark model.
