# Recap: hadrons and leptons

1. Give an example of a hadron and a lepton.
2. Which force do hadrons experience, but leptons do not?
3. Name a force that both hadrons and leptons experience.

# Part 3: the quark model

5. simple quark model of hadrons in terms of up, down and strange quarks and their respective anti-quarks

6. quark model of the proton (uud) and the neutron (udd)

7. charges of the up (u), down (d), strange (s), anti-up (u), anti-down (d) and the anti-strange (s) quarks as fractions of the elementary charge e

# The quark model

- all **hadrons** are not fundamental - they are made of **quarks**
- **baryons** are made of 3 quarks $qqq$
- **antibaryons** are made of 3 _antiquarks_ $\overline{qqq}$
- **mesons** are made of quark antiquark pair

# Strangeness

- a _quantum number_ introduced to explain why some decays occur, and others do not
- the first clue as to the quark structure of hadrons
- now it is understood that strangeness is due to the presence of the strange quark - which is unsta

#### The three quark model

| quark     | charge         | strangeness |
| --------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| $u$       | $+\frac{2}{3}$ | 0           |
| $d$       | $-\frac{1}{3}$ | 0           |
| $s$       | $-\frac{1}{3}$ | -1          |
| $\bar{u}$ | $-\frac{2}{3}$ | 0           |
| $\bar{d}$ | $+\frac{1}{3}$ | 0           |
| $\bar{s}$ | $+\frac{1}{3}$ | +1          |

# Hadrons are made of quarks

- hadrons are divided into _baryons_ and _mesons_
- a baryon is made of three quarks $qqq$
  - _e.g. proton is uud_
- antibaryon $\bar{q}\bar{q}\bar{q}$
- a meson is made of a quark-antiquark pair $q\bar{q}$
