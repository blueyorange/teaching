## 6.4.3 Radioactivity
### Part 1: Radioactive decay


- radioactive decay; spontaneous and random nature of decay

- α-particles, β-particles and γ-rays; nature, penetration and range of these radiations;techniques and procedures used to investigate the absorption of α-particles, β-particles and γ-rays by appropriate materials

- nuclear decay equations for alpha, beta- minus and beta-plus decays; balancing nuclear transformation equations

# Radioactive decay

* Of the first 82 elements in the periodic table, 80 have **stable isotopes**
* technetium (Z=43) and promethium (Z=61) do not have any stable isotopes and so are not found naturally
* **unstable isotopes** may **decay** by one or more decay mode: alpha, beta+, beta-, electron capture, or spontaneous fission

# The random nature of radioactive decay

Radioactive decay is random because you **cannot predict** when an **individual nucleus** will decay. There is only a _probability_.

# Cloud chamber

- chamber of _saturated vapour_
- charged particles cause _condensation_, a bit like aeroplane vapour trails
- alcohol droplets formed on particle trajectories allowing us to visualise particle tracks
- uncharged particles (e.g. gamma) do not show up

# Alpha decay

- alpha tracks are **bold** and **straight**
- range is around 10 cm, depending on energy
- all alpha particles from same isotope have same energy

# Beta decay

- tracks are **thin** and **wispy**
- range is about 1 metre in air

# Nuclear equations

## Alpha decay

$$_Z^AX \rightarrow _{Z-2}^{A-4}Y + _2^4He$$
for example, americium (Am) 241

$$_{95}^{241}Am \rightarrow _{93}^{237}Np + _2^4He$$

# Nuclear equations

## Beta decay

$$_Z^AX \rightarrow _{Z+1}^{A}Y + ^0_{-1}\beta + \bar{\nu}_e$$

### The decay of **strontium 90**

$$_{38}^{90}Sr \rightarrow _{39}^{90}Y + ^0_{-1}\beta + \bar{\nu}_e$$
_nb element Y is Yttrium!_

# Activity and Count Rate

## Activity (A)
> The total number of radioactive particles decaying per unit time.

## Count Rate (C)
> The number of radioactive particles counted by a radiation detector per unit time.

The count rate is _proportional_ to the activity of a source, but is of course smaller.

---

# Half-life

In GCSE Physics you learned about _half-life_.
> The **time taken** for the activity A and number of undecayed nuclei N to fall to **half** of the initial value.

# Radioactive dice

1. Roll 100 dice
2. Remove all dice showing '1'
3. Record the number remaining N
4. Repeat until no dice left

Plot a graph of $N$ against $t$ and $ln(N)$ against $t$ and identify the **half-life**.

# The Maths of Radioactive Decay

## Decay constant $\lambda$
> The probability per unit time of a nucleus decaying.

It has units of $s^{-1}$.
This leads to the equation

$$\Delta N = -\lambda N \Delta t$$
or
$$A = \frac{\Delta N}{\Delta t} = -\lambda N$$

The decay constant has an _inverse_ relationship with the half-life $t_{\frac{1}{2}}$.

# Questions on the decay constant

1. State the definition of _decay constant_ and its symbol.
2. The decay constant of radioactive isotope A is twice as great as isotope B. Compare their _half-lives_.
3. A sample of $10^{10}$ radioactive atoms has a decay constant of $0.1\text{ s}^{-1}$. Estimate the number of radioactive decays in the first second.
4. What is the value of N after one second?
5. The half life can be calculate using the formula $t_{1/2}=\frac{ln(2)}{\lambda}$. Calculate the half-life. What are the units here?
6. Uranium 235 has a half-life of 4.5 billion years. Calculate the decay constant in $s^{-1}$.

---

# Answers

1. Probability per unit time of a nucleus decaying, $\lambda$.
2. The half-life of isotope A is half as great as isotope B.
3. $A=\Delta N=\lambda N \Delta t = 0.1 \times 10^{10} = 10^9$ decays.
4. $10^{10}-10^9 = 9.0 \times 10^9$.
5. 6.9 s.
6. 4.5 billion yr = $1.4 \times 10^{17}$ so $t_{1/2}=5.0 \times 10^{-18} \text{ s}^{-1}$.

# Exponential decay

## What is exponential decay?

- Rate is proportional to number remaining.
$$\frac{\Delta N}{\Delta t} \propto -\lambda N$$
- Falls by a _constant ratio_ in same _time interval_.
- _Power laws_ are **not** exponentials (e.g. _inverse-square_ law of gravity)!
