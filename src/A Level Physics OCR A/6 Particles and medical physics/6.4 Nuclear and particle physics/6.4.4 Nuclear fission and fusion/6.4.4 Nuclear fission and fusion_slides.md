## 6.4.4 Nuclear fission and fusion (part 1)

1. Einstein’s mass–energy equation; $E=mc^2$

2. energy released (or absorbed) in simple nuclear
reactions

3. creation and annihilation of particle–antiparticle pairs

# Mass and energy

- Einstein's **theory of special relativity** states that mass and energy are **equivalent**

$$E=mc^2$$

- Increases in energy result in **negligible** increases in mass
- Small mass changes can result in **huge** energy changes!

# Worked example 1

### A 100 g potato is warmed from room temperature at 20 degrees C to 100 degrees C in the microwave.
### Calculate the increase in mass of the potato, assuming it is composed entirely of water.

#### Solution
$$Q = mc\Delta T= 0.1 \times 4200 \times (100-20) = 33,600 \text{ J}$$
$$m=\frac{E}{c^2}=\frac{33600}{(3.0 \times 10^8)^2}=3.7 \times 10^{-13} \text{ kg}$$

This is a **negligible** change in mass.

# Worked example 2

### Calculate the energy released during the alpha decay of Am 241.

$$_{95}^{241}Am \rightarrow _{93}^{237}Np + _2^4He$$
