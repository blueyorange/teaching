## 6.4.4 Nuclear fission and fusion (part 1)

1. Einstein’s mass–energy equation; $E=mc^2$

2. energy released (or absorbed) in simple nuclear
reactions

3. creation and annihilation of particle–antiparticle pairs

# Mass and energy

- Einstein's **theory of special relativity** states that mass and energy are **equivalent**

$$E=mc^2$$

- Increases in energy result in **negligible** increases in mass
- Small mass changes can result in **huge** energy changes!

# Worked example 1

### A 100 g potato is warmed from room temperature at 20 degrees C to 100 degrees C in the microwave.
### Calculate the increase in mass of the potato, assuming it is composed entirely of water.

#### Solution
$$Q = mc\Delta T= 0.1 \times 4200 \times (100-20) = 33,600 \text{ J}$$
$$m=\frac{E}{c^2}=\frac{33600}{(3.0 \times 10^8)^2}=3.7 \times 10^{-13} \text{ kg}$$

This is a **negligible** change in mass.

# Worked example 2

### Calculate the energy released during the alpha decay of Am 241.

$$_{95}^{241}Am \rightarrow _{93}^{237}Np + _2^4He$$

## 6.4.4 Nuclear fission and fusion (part 2)

4. mass defect; binding energy; binding energy per nucleon

5. binding energy per nucleon against nucleon number curve; energy changes in reactions

6. binding energy of nuclei using $E=mc^2$ and masses of nuclei

# The unified atomic mass unit u

> 1u = $\frac{1}{12}$ of the mass of a carbon 12 atom.

- This gives 1u = $1.611 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg}$ (see datasheet)

- In energy terms, this is equal to 931.5 MeV.

- It is a convenient unit to use for atomic masses.

- Since 1 mole of carbon atoms has a mass of 12g, one mole of atoms of any element has a mass equal to its relative atomic mass in u.

# Binding energy
> the minimum energy **required** to break up a nucleus into its **constituent** nucleons

or

> the energy **released** when a nucleus is **formed** from its constituent nucleons

Binding energy **increases** as nuclear mass **increases**.

---

# Binding energy per nucleon

- nuclear **stability** increases with **binding energy per nucleon**
- the most stable isotope is iron (Fe) 56
- energy is **released** when binding energy per nucleon **increases**
- fission releases energy for **heavy** nuclei
- fusion releases energy for **light** nuclei

## 6.4.4 Nuclear fission and fusion (part 3)

7. induced nuclear fission; chain reaction

8. basic structure of a fission reactor; components –
fuel rods, control rods and moderator

9. environmental impact of nuclear waste

---

# Induced fission
- _Nuclear fission_ is the splitting of heavy nuclei into lighter nuclei, during which energy is released
- _Spontaneous_ fission is a rare form of radioactive decay
- _Induced fission_ occurs when a nucleus absorbs a neutron, which causes the fission

---

# Describe the process of induced fission for uranium 235

- A nucleus **absorbs** a _thermal neutron_ to form uranium 236
- this then splits to form **two daughter nuclei** and releases two or three high speed **neutrons**
- these neutrons can go on to form further fissions

---

# Describe what happens to the neutrons in a _controlled chain reaction_

- during fission two to three neutrons are released
- these can go on to form further fissions
- controlled chain reaction if on average one of those neutrons causes another fission
- the other two neutrons are _absorbed_ [by control rods]

---

# Inside a nuclear reactor core

- **fuels rods**  contain a mixture of mostly uranium 235 and some uranium 238
- boron **control rods** can be raised and lowered and absorb excess neutrons to control the rate of fission
- graphite **moderator** reduces te speed of neutrons to thermal (~eV) speeds to increase the probability of absorption

# Environmental implications of nuclear waste

You need to know:

- types of nuclear waste
- how it is treated
- why each type of waste is problematic

---

# Types of radioactive waste

level | waste | treatment
--- | --- | ---
high | spent fuel rods | cooling ponds (years) -> separation/recycling fuel -> vitrification -> containers -> buried
medium | reactory components; core graphite; | treated -> packed in containers -> sealed underground
low | recycled; incinerated; placed in containers and disposed

---

# Problems and solutions for high level waste

Problem | Solution
--- | ---
very **hot** | **cooling ponds**
very **radioactive** | water/**cooling ponds** (to absorb radiation)
**liquid** form | vitrification (stored in pyrex glass)
long half-lives ~ thousand(s) years | long-term storage in **geologically stable areas**

# Nuclear fission and fusion (part 4)

10. nuclear fusion; fusion reactions and temperature

11. balancing nuclear transformation equations
