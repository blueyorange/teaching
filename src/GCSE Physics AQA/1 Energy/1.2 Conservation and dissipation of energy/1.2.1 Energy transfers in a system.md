## 1.2.1 Energy transfers in a system


- State and apply the principle of conservation of energy.
- Give examples of _closed systems_ where the total energy remains the same.
- State what is meant by energy _dissipation_.
- Give examples of _dissipation_ and how to reduce it.
- List factors which would affect energy transfer by conduction, for example in a building.
- **Required practical activity 2**: investigate the effectiveness of different materials as thermal insulators and the factors that may affect the thermal insulation properties of a material.
