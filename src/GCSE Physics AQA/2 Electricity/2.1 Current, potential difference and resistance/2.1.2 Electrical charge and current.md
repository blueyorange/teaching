#### <span id='date-time'>today's date</span>

### <u>Current, resistance and potential difference</u>

### Starter

Draw a circuit diagram showing a **cell** connected in **series** with a **switch** and a **lamp**.

<script>
  document.querySelector('#date-time').innerHTML = new Date(Date.now()).toDateString();

# Who has ever had an electric shock?

## Where? When? What did it feel like?

## What caused it?

# Who has ever had an electric shock?

- an electric shock is **electric current** passing through your body
- it happens when a there is a **potential difference** applied to you

# Effects of electric shock

- Below 1 Milliamp Generally not perceptible
- 1 Milliamp Faint Tingle
- 5 Milliamps Slight shock felt. Not painful but disturbing.
- Average individual can let go. Strong involuntary
  reactions can lead to other injuries.
- 6 to 30 Milliamps Painful shocks. Loss of muscle control.

---

# Effects of electric shock

- 50 to 150 Milliamps Extreme pain, respiratory arrest, severe muscle
  reactions. Death is possible.
- 1.0 to 4.3 Amps Rhythmic pumping action of the heart ceases.

## 2.1.2 Electrical charge and current

- rate of flow of **charge**
- conservation of **charge**
- Calculate the **charge** flow using the equation $Q = It$.

<!-- Use the simulation to build a simple circuit consisting of a cell and a lamp. Use a human model to illustrate movement of charge past a certain point. Demonstrate conventional current and the movement of charge. Discuss conservation of charge.

# Models to help us understand

- electricity is not easy to understand
- we cannot **see** it
- the quantities are **abstract**
- we can use **models** to help us

---

# Human model of electricity

- people represent **charge**
- How fast people move represent the **current**

---

# Bicycle chain model

# Learning check

1. **Charge** is measured in ...
2. **Current** is measured in ...
3. **Current** is the rate of flow of ...
4. **Conventional current** moves from ... to ...
5. **Electrons** are ... charged
6. One **amp** of **current** means that one ... of **charge** is moving past every ...
7. Charge is **conserved**. What does this mean?

---

# Calculating Current

$$Q=It$$
charge = current x time

$Q$ charge in _coulombs_ \(C)
$A$ current in _amperes_ (A)
$t$ time in _seconds_ (s)

---

# Worked Example 1

An ammeter measures 3.0 A of current. How much charge flows through the ammeter in 0.7 s?

## Solution

$$
\begin{align}
Q &= It\\
Q &= 3.0 \times 0.7\\
Q &= \text{ ???}
\end{align}
$$

### Remember to write a unit!

# Worked Example 2

6.0 C of charge moves through an ammeter in 4.0 s. What is the current?

## Solution

$$
\begin{align}
Q &= It\\
6.0 &=  I \times 4.0\\
\text{rearrange: }I &= \frac{6.0}{4.0} = \text{...}
\end{align}
$$
