## 2.1.3 Current, resistance and potential difference


- State that current _through_ a component increases with potential difference _across_ a component and decreases with the resistance _of_ a component.
- Calculate current, p.d., or resistance using the equation $I = \frac{V}{R}$
- _Required practical activity 3_: Use circuit diagrams to set up and check appropriate circuits to investigate the factors affecting the resistance of electrical circuits.
