# <u>Current, resistance and potential difference</u>

### starter (copy and complete)

A 2.0 A current flows for one minute. How many coulombs of charge go past?

$$Q=It$$

# Recap

1. Define 'electric current'.
2. What is the unit of electric **current**?
3. What is the unit of electric **charge**?
4. What is the direction of conventional current?
5. Which direction do electrons move in around a circuit?

# Starter

# The power lines are at a **HIGH VOLTAGE**.

## Why are the birds unharmed?

## 2.1.3 Current, resistance and potential difference

- what happens to current if p.d. increases?
- what happens to p.d. if resistance increases?
- what happens to current if resistance increases?
- Calculate current, p.d., or resistance using the equation $I = \frac{V}{R}$

- _Required practical activity 3_: Use circuit diagrams to set up and check appropriate circuits to investigate the factors affecting the resistance of electrical circuits.

# Starter

- the birds are at a high voltage
- there is a **potential difference** (voltage) between the birds and the ground
- but the air has a VERY high **resistance** (it is an **insulator**)
- **current** cannot flow

# Your turn!

## Explain why birds sitting on a power line are unharmed using words like **current**, **resistance**, **potential difference**.

_Birds sitting on a high voltage power line are unharmed because..._
