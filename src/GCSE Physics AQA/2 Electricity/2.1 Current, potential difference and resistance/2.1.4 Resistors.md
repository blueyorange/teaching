## 2.1.4 Resistors


- Sketch a graph of current vs voltage for an _ohmic conductor_, _filament lamp_, and _semiconductor diode_
- Describe how the resistance changes with applied p.d. for an _ohmic conductor_, _filament lamp_, _semiconductor diode_
- State that the resistance of a a thermistor decreases as the temperature increases
- Discuss the applications of thermistors in circuits (thermostats)
- State that the resistance of an LDR decreases as light intensity increases
- Describe how an LDR is used to switch lights on when it gets dark
- explain the design and use of a circuit to measure the resistance of a component by measuring the current through, and potential difference across, the component
- draw an appropriate circuit diagram using correct circuit symbols
- **Required practical activity 4**: use circuit diagrams to construct appropriate circuits to investigate the Iâ€“V characteristics of a variety of circuit elements, including a filament lamp, a diode and a resistor at constant temperature.
