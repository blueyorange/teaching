## 2.2.1 Series and parallel

- Identify whether two circuit components are joined in series or in parallel
- use circuit diagrams to construct and check series and parallel circuits that include a variety of common circuit components
- Describe the difference between series and parallel circuits
- explain qualitatively why adding resistors in series increases the total resistance but adding resistors in parallel decreases the total resistance
