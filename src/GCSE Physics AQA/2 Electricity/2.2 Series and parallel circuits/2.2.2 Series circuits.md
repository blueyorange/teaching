## 2.2.2 Series circuits


State and apply these rules:

- there is the same current through each component
- the total p.d. of the power supply is **shared** between the components
- the total resistance of the components is the sum of the resistance of each component: $R_{total} = R_1 + R_2$
- calculate the currents, potential differences and resistances in dc series circuits
- solve problems for circuits which include resistors in series using the concept of equivalent resistance.
- explain the design and use of dc series circuits for measurement and testing purposes
