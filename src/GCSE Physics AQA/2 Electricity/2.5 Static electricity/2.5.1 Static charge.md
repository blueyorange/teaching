## 2.5.1 Static charge

- describe the production of static electricity, and sparking, by rubbing surfaces
- describe evidence that charged objects exert forces of attraction or repulsion on one another when not in contact
- explain how the transfer of electrons between objects can
  explain the phenomena of static electricity

# Starter: true or false?

- there are two types of electric charge
- charge is stored in the cell (battery) and is used up over time
- charge is used up in a circuit
- the cell (battery) is a source of energy

---

## 2.1.2 Electrical charge and current

- State that electric current is the rate of flow of electrical charge.
- Electrical charge is _conserved_
- Calculate the charge flow using the equation $Q = It$.

# The history of electricity

- The ancient greeks realised that when **amber** is rubbed against **wool** it can be used to pick up small pieces of parchment
- the greek word for amber is **elektron**!

---

# Electric charge

- **positive** and **negative**
- opposite charge attract
- like charges repel
- the unit of electric charge is the **coulomb** C
- electrons can **move** from one material to another
- electrons have a **negative** charge

# 'Charging' your phone

## Energy is _not_ charge

- this is different use of the word 'charge'
- when we 'charge' our phones we are giving them more energy

# Electric current

- **rate of flow of charge**
- measured in **amperes** A
- 1 ampere is one coulomb per second
