# Density in solids, liquids, and gases

- use the equation for density $\rho = \frac{m}{V}$
- recognise/draw simple diagrams to model the difference between solids, liquids, and gases
- explain the differences in density between the different states of matter in terms of the arrangement of atoms or molecules
- **Required Practical 5** use appropriate apparatus to make and record the measurements needed to determine the densities of regular and irregular solid objects and liquids.
