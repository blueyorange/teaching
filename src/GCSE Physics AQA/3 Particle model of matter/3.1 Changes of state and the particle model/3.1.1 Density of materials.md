# Density in solids, liquids, and gases

- **recognise/draw** simple diagrams to model the difference between solids, liquids, and gases
- **explain** the differences in density between the different states of matter in terms of the arrangement of atoms or molecules

# Starter: annotate your diagrams

What do you know? Write as much as you can!

# What is density?

> Density is the ratio of **mass** to **volume**.

Objects with the greater mass but which take up the same volume are **more/less** dense.
Objects with the same mass but which take up more volume are **more/less** dense.

# Will ice float?

### Predict-explain-observe-explain

- Write a **prediction**.
  - _ice will float/not float_.
- Write an **explanation**.
  - _why_ do you think this?
- Write an **observation**.
  - _ice does/does not float._
- Write an **explanation**.
  - were you right? Explain.

# Refutation text sentence starters

Copy and complete each

Many people believe that...

- ...particles in a gas are bigger than the particles in a solid, but...
- ...there are gaps between the particles in a liquid, but really...
- ...the density of all liquids is much less than the density of solids...

---

# Similarities and differences

- Take on whole page on its side.
- Draw particle diagrams for a solid and a liquid OR a liquid and a gas.
- Write similarities in the behaviour of the particles

> _If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generation of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the atomic hypothesis that all things are made of atoms â€” little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. In that one sentence, you will see, there is an enormous amount of information about the world, if just a little imagination and thinking are applied._
