# Refutation text sentence starters

Copy and complete each

Many people believe that...

- ...particles in a gas are bigger than the particles in a solid, but...
- ...there are gaps between the particles in a liquid, but really...
- ...the density of all liquids is much less than the density of solids...

# Similarities and differences

- Take on whole page on its side.
- Draw particle diagrams for a solid and a liquid OR a liquid and a gas.
- Write similarities in the behaviour of the particles
