## 3.2.1 Internal energy

- State that internal energy is the **total kinetic and potential energy** of all the particles in a system
- Explain that changes in **internal energy** can result from a change in temperature **or** a change of state

# Temperature and Internal Energy

## Temperature
> A measure of how **hot** something is.

## Internal energy
> The total **potential** and **kinetic** energy of all the particles in an object.

## Heat
> The transfer of **thermal energy** into or out of an object.

# Temperature vs. internal energy

* The match is **hotter** - higher **temperature**
* The bath contains more **internal energy**
