## 3.2.1 Internal energy

- State that internal energy is the **total kinetic and potential energy** of all the particles in a system
- Explain that changes in **internal energy** can result from a change in temperature **or** a change of state

# Temperature and Internal Energy

## Temperature
> A measure of the **average kinetic energy** of the particles in a substance.

Temperature is measured in degrees celsius ($\degree$C) or kelvin (K).

## Internal energy
> The total **potential** and **kinetic** energy of all the particles in an object.

## Heat
> The transfer of **thermal energy** into or out of an object.

Internal energy and heat are measured in **joules** (J).

# Temperature vs. internal energy

* The match is **hotter** - higher **temperature**
* The bath contains more **internal energy**

# Stearic Acid Investigation

Can you find the **melting point** of the stearic acid?

_Hint: measure the temperature every 30 seconds. Watch for where it doesn't change._

# An ice cube melts. Describe using the idea of _internal energy_, _temperature_, and _heat_.

*The ice cube absorbs _________ from its environment. As it melts, the outside of the cube stays at the same ____________. The energy goes into breaking bonds between molecules, so the ___________________ is increasing.*

- Think of three more examples of energy changes and write paragraphs for them, as above.


---

# Examples
For each one, write what happens to _temperature_, _internal energy_.

scenario | temperature | heat | internal energy
---|---|---|---
_a cup of coffee cools down_ | _goes down_ | _to surroundings_ | _goes down_
_an ice cube melts_ |
_a kettle boils_
