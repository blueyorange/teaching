## 3.2.2 Temperature changes in a system and specific heat capacity


- Calculate changes in thermal energy using the equation $\Delta E = m c \Delta \theta$
- Define specific heat capacity

# How much energy to change the temperature?

Different materials require different amounts of **energy** to change **temperature**. The amount of energy needed depends on:

* the **mass** of the material
* the desired **temperature change**
* the substance of the material (**specific heat capacity**)

# Heat capacity

# Specific Heat Capacity

## Heat Capacity
> The amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of an object by 1$\degree$C.

## _It takes more energy to heat a bath of water than it takes to warm a mug of coffee._

---

## Specific Heat Capacity
> The amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of **1kg** of a material by 1$\degree$C.

$$\Delta E = m c \Delta \theta$$

- $\Delta E$ is heat in joules (J)
- $m$ is mass (kg)
- $c$ is specific heat capacity (J/kg&#176;C)
- $\Delta \theta$ is **change in temperature** in &#176;C

# Worked example 1

### Calculate the energy needed to raise the temperature of 0.2 kg of water from 20$\degree$C to 100 $\degree$C. The **specific heat capacity** of water is 4200 J/kg$\degree$C.
$$\begin{align}
\Delta E &= m c \Delta \theta \\
&= 0.2 \times 4200 \times (100-20) \\
&= \text{67200 J}
\end{align}$$

# Starter question
$$\Delta E = m c \Delta \theta$$
Calculate the energy needed to raise the temperature of 5 kg of concrete by 10 degrees. The specific heat capacity of concrete is 800 J/kg&#176;C.

- $\Delta E$ is heat in joules (J)
- $m$ is mass (kg)
- $c$ is specific heat capacity (J/kg&#176;C)
- $\Delta \theta$ is **change in temperature** in &#176;C

# Starter question

Calculate the energy needed to raise the temperature of 5 kg of concrete by 10 degrees. The specific heat capacity of concrete is 800 J/kg&#176;C.

## Solution
$$
\begin{align}
\Delta E &= m c \Delta \theta \\
&= 5 \times 800 \times 10 \\
&=40000 \text{ J}
\end{align}
$$

### The element and block will get HOT so take care.
- Try to match your result to the metal in the table below.

metal | specific heat capacity $c$ / J/kg&#176;C
--- | ---
aluminium | 900
iron | 450
copper | 380
