## 3.2.3 Changes of state and specific latent heat

- Describe latent heat as the energy needed for a substance to change state
- Define specific latent heat
- Use the equation $E=mL$
- Distinguish between latent heat of fusion and vapourisation
- Interpret heating and cooling graphs that include changes of state

---

# Specific Latent Heat of fusion
> The energy required to change 1 kg of ice to 1kg of water at constant temperature.

# Specific latent heat of vapourisation
> The energy required to change 1 kg of liquid water to 1kg of steam at room temperature.

$$E=mL$$
- E: latent heat in joules (J)
- m: mass in kilograms (kg)
- L: specific latent heat
