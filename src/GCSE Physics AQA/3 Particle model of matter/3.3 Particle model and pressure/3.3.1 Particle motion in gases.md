# Starter

## Which statements are true for particles in a **gas**?

1. The particles all move in a predictable way.
2. The particles move at the same speed.
3. The particles move in circular paths.
4. The particles move in random directions.
5. The particles move with a range of speeds.
6. The particles vibrate about fixed positions.

## 3.3.1 Particle motion in gases

- explain how the **motion of the molecules** in a gas is related to both its **temperature** and its **pressure**
- explain _qualitatively_ the relation between the **temperature** of a gas and its **pressure** at constant volume

# Air pressure

## We live at the bottom of an _ocean of air_ called the **atmosphere**.

- the air pressure here is about 100,000 pascals (Pa) (100 kPa)
- this is also called _1 atmosphere (atm)_
- 1 Pa = 1 _newton per square meter_ ($N/m^2$)

# Going up

- as we gain _altitude_, air gets thinner
- air pressure _decreases_ with altitude
- the pressure at the top of Mount Everest is about 0.3 atm

# Gas particles

This picture is a _model_ of particles in gases.

- random
- range of speeds
- move in **straight lines**

What happens if we increase the **temperature**?

# Gas particles and temperature

- as the **temperature** increases, the **average kinetic energy** of the particles increases
- this means that the **average speed** of the particles increases

---

# Gas pressure

- Gas pressure is caused by **collisions** between the **particles** and the container **surface**.
- The more **collisions**, the greater the **force** exerted

How could the pressure from be increased?

- More collisions **per unit area** (decrease **volume**)
- Faster particles (increase the **temperature**)

---

# Summary

- Gas particles move **randomly** at a **range of speeds**
- Pressure is caused by particle **collisions**
- Pressure can be **increased** by
  - decreasing **volume**
  - increasing **temperature**

# Use the **Gas Properties** simulation and copy and complete the sentences...

1. As **temperature** of a gas increases, the pressure **\_\_\_\_** because...
2. As **number of particles in the box** increases, the pressure **\_\_\_** because...
3. As **volume** increases, the **pressure** increases because...

Can you **investigate** the relationship between these variables?
Carry out an **investigation**, recording your results in a table, and write a **conclusion**.
