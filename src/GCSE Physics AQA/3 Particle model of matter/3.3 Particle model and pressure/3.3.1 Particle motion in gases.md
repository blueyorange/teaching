## Which statements are true for particles in a **gas**?

1. The particles all move in a predictable way.
2. The particles move at the same speed.
3. The particles move in circular paths.
4. The particles move in random directions.
5. The particles move with a range of speeds.
6. The particles vibrate about fixed positions.

## 3.3.1 Particle motion in gases

- explain how the **motion of the molecules** in a gas is related to both its **temperature** and its **pressure**
- explain _qualitatively_ the relation between the **temperature** of a gas and its **pressure** at constant volume

---

# Gas particles

This picture is a _model_ of particles in gases.
They

- move **randomly**
- have a **range of speeds**
- move in **straight lines**

# Particles and pressure

Remember that pressure is _force per unit area_.

- How do gas particles exert a force on the container walls?
- How could it be increased?

# Pressure and temperature

- Pressure is caused by **collisions** between particles and the walls of the container
- Temperature is (proportional to) the **average kinetic energy** of the particles.
- When particles move faster there are more **frequent collisions** and they exert more force on the container walls.

## Put it in your own words (in complete sentences)

1. What happens to the pressure of a gas as the temperature is increased?
2. Why does this happen?

## Then... use the PhET simulation 'gas properties' to investigate

---

# Investigate

## What happens to the **pressure** of a gas as we increase the **temperature** at constant volume?

1. Choose 6 different temperatures to test
2. Measure the pressure at each temperature
3. Record your results in a table (see below)

| T / $\degree$C | p / kPa |
| -------------- | ------- |

4. Plot a graph of your results

---

# Conclusion

1. What does your graph look like?
2. Does it match our prediction?
3. Is it a straight line or a curve?
4. What is the loest possible temperature?
5. What is the lowest possible pressure?

---

# Summary

- Gas particles move **randomly** at a **range of speeds**
- Pressure is caused by particle **collisions**
- Increasing the **temperature** of a gas increases it's **pressure** if the volume stays constant

---

# Questions

1. Describe how particles in a gas move.
2. Describe what happens to particles as the temperature increases.
3. How do particles/atoms/molecules in a gas exert a pressure?
