## 3.3.2 Pressure in gases

- Identify the direction in which pressure acts (right angles to wall)
- Use the particle model to explain how increasing the volume in which a gas is contained, at constant temperature, can lead to a decrease in pressure.
- Calculate using Boyle's law $pV = c$ where $c$ is a constant, or equivalently $p_1V_1 = p_2V_2$

# Pressure and volume

- Pressure in gases is caused by collisions of particles with the container surface.
- Volume is the **amount of space** a gas takes up
- As volume increases, pressure decreases, because there are fewer collisions per unit area
- As volume decreases...
