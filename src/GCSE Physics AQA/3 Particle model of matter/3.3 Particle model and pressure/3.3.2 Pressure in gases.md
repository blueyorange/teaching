## 3.3.2 Pressure in gases

- Identify the direction in which pressure acts (right angles to wall)
- Use the particle model to explain how increasing the volume in which a gas is contained, at constant temperature, can lead to a decrease in pressure.
- Calculate using Boyle's law $pV = c$ where $c$ is a constant, or equivalently $p_1V_1 = p_2V_2$
