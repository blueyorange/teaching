## 3.3.3 Increasing the pressure of a gas

- Explain that doing work on a gas increases the internal energy of the gas and can cause an increase in the temperature of a gas.
- Explain how, in a given situation eg a bicycle pump, doing work on an enclosed gas leads to an increase in the temperature of the gas.

# Fire piston

- If I push the piston in, work is done _on_ the gas.
- As the piston springs back, work is done _by_ the gas.
- If I push the piston in slowly, the energy is transferred to the _surroundings_.

## What happens if I push the piston in **really** fast?

## Why?

# Key question

## Why does the temperature of the gas **increase** when the piston is rapidly pushed in?

### Answer using **work done** and **internal energy**.

1. Why does the temperature not change when the piston is pushed in **slowly**?
2. What might happen when the piston is pulled **out** rapidly?
3. Why is the gas from a fire extinguisher **cold**?

# Intake

![bg right fit](http://animatedengines.com/img/diesel_int.gif)

<!-- The left valve opens and the engine draws in air -->

---

# Compression

![bg right fit](http://animatedengines.com/img/diesel_cmp.gif)

<!-- The air is compressed to a high temperature-->

---

# Injection

# Power

# Exhaust

# Task

- Cut and stick the five diagrams into your book
- Arrange them in a cycle
- Label them with **intake, compression, injection, power, exhaust**
- Describe what is happening at each stage
- In what stages
  - is work done **on** the gas?
  - does the gas **do work**?
  - is **chemical energy** transferred to **internal energy**?

# 4 stroke vs. petrol engine

| phase          | 4-stroke                                | diesel        |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| intake         | a mixture of air and fuel               | pure air      |
| compression    | work is done; internal energy increases | same          |
| injection      | _no injection_                          | fuel injected |
| power/ignition | spark plug                              | compression   |
| exhaust        | waste gases emitted                     | same          |
