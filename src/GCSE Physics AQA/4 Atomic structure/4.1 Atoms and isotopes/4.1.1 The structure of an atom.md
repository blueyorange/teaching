# :blue_book: Do It Now! :stopwatch:

:teacher: Prior knowledge check

1. Draw a quick picture of an atom. Identify the parts.
2. What is the correct order of the e-m spectrum from longest to shortest wavelength (**R**emember **M**y **I**nstructions...)
3. Which parts are **ionising** radiation?
4. Draw a light ray passing through a glass block.

## 4.1.1 Structure of the atom :atom_symbol:

- state the approximate **atomic radius**
- describe the basic structure of an atom, including **protons**, **neutrons**, **electrons** and their **relative charge** and **relative mass**
- state the approximate **nuclear radius**
- state that **electrons** are arranged at different distances from the nucleus
- describe how **absorption** and **emission** of **electromagnetic radiation** causes changes to electron energies

# **atom**

Comes from the ancient greek _atomos_ meaning **indivisible**.

## Structure of the atom

For a neutral atom, what can we say about...

- electrons and protons?
- neutrons and protons?

### Structure

For a **neutral** atom

- #electrons = #protons
- #neutrons $\approx$ #protons (approximately equal)
- electrons with higher **energy** are **further** from the nucleus

# Reminder: Standard form and powers of ten

- 1.0 m is written as $1.0 \times 10^0$ m
- 0.1 m becomes $1 \times 10^{-1}$ m
- 0.01 becomes $1 \times 10^{-2}$ m (1cm)

:memo: write 1 mm in metres in standard form

# Atoms are **small** :atom_symbol:

- Imagine a blueberry :blueberries:
- Blown up to the size of the **Earth** :earth_africa:
- The **atoms** are now blueberry size! :scream_cat: :exploding_head:

Atomic radius is $\approx 10^{-10}$ m (one ten-billionth of a metre!).

### The nucleus is 100,000 times smaller than an atom

![bg right:40%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/London_Wembley.jpg/500px-London_Wembley.jpg)

$\approx 10^{-15}$ m

## Relative charges and masses

| particle | relative mass | relative charge |
| -------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| proton   | +1            | +1              |
| neutron  | +1            | 0               |
| electron | 1/2000        | -1              |

Nb: AQA allows you to consider the electron as having a _very small_ or _negligible_ mass.

# Gaining and losing energy

- electrons can **gain** energy by absorbing **electromagnetic radiation** usually in the form of:
  - infra-red
  - visible
  - ultraviolet
- The electron is **unstable** in the higher energy level, so is quickly **re-emitted**
