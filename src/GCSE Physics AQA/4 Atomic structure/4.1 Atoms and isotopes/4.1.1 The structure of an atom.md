# Do It Now! :stopwatch:

:teacher: Prior knowledge check

:book: Draw a diagram of an atom. Label it with as much information as you can.

## 4.1.1 Structure of the atom :atom_symbol:

- state the approximate **atomic radius**
- describe the basic structure of an atom, including **protons**, **neutrons**, **electrons** and their **relative charge** and **relative mass**
- state the approximate **nuclear radius**
- state that **electrons** are arranged at different distances from the nucleus
- describe how **absorption** and **emission** of **electromagnetic radiation** causes changes to electron energies

# **atom**

Comes from the ancient greek _atomos_ meaning **indivisible**.

---

# Structure of the atom

- the number of electrons = number of protons for a **neutral atom**
- If they are not, it is called an **ion**

# Reminder: Standard form and powers of ten

- 1.0 m is written as $1.0 \times 10^0$ m
- 0.1 m becomes $1 \times 10^{-1}$ m
- 0.01 becomes $1 \times 10^{-2}$ m (1cm)

:memo: write 1 mm in metres in standard form

# Powers of Ten Video

Watch the [video](https://youtu.be/44cv416bKP4?feature=shared&t=368), thinking about:

- How small is an atom? :atom_symbol:
- How small is a nucleus? :radioactive:
- How much smaller is the nucleus than the atom?

---

# What are particles?

- Particles have **charge** and **mass**
- What force acts on **mass**?
- What force acts on **charge**?

---

## Relative charges and masses

| particle | relative mass | relative charge |
| -------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| proton   | +1            | +1              |
| neutron  | +1            | 0               |
| electron | 1/2000        | -1              |

Nb: AQA allows you to consider the electron as having a _very small_ or _negligible_ mass.

# Atoms are **small** :atom_symbol:

- Imagine a blueberry :blueberries:
- Blown up to the size of the **Earth** :earth_africa:
- The **atoms** are now blueberry size! :scream_cat: :exploding_head:

Atomic radius is $\approx 10^{-10}$ m (one ten-billionth of a metre!).

---

## The nucleus is **smaller**

![bg right](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/London_Wembley.jpg/500px-London_Wembley.jpg)

Like a speck of dust in Wembley stadium!

$\approx 10^{-15}$ m

# Electrons

- electrons are at different **distances** from the nucleus
- the further they are, the **more energy** they have

---

# Recall: absorption of radiation

# Emission of EM Radiation

# Gaining and losing energy

- electrons can **gain** energy by absorbing **electromagnetic radiation** usually in the form of:
  - infra-red
  - visible
  - ultraviolet
- The electron is **unstable** in the higher energy level, so is quickly **re-emitted**

---

# :blue_book: Questions

1. Add some more information to the picture you drew at the start of the lesson if you can.
2. Describe the structure of the atom in words.
3. Describe the process of an atom absorbing electromagnetic radiation in words
4. Draw a storyboard showing an atom **absorbing** electromagnetic radiation, then **re-emitting** it

---

#### Describe the **structure** of the atom in words

- _The nucleus contains..._
- _The proton and neutron have similar... but different_
- _The electron..._

**mass, charge, negligible**

---

#### Describe the process of an atom absorbing electromagnetic radiation in words

# Challenge questions

5. Let's say a blueberry is 1.3 cm in diameter. The diameter of the earth is about 13,000 km. Show that if a blueberry was blown up to the size of the Earth, the atoms would be roughly the same size as the blueberry.
6. Calculate the approximate volume of an atom. The volume of a sphere is $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.
7. Estimate the density of

- a hydrogen atom
- a hydrogen **nucleus**

7. Think of another scenario, like the dust in Wembley stadium, which illustrates the scale of an atom.
