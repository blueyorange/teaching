# Do It Now! :stopwatch:

:teacher: Prior knowledge check

:book: Draw a diagram of an atom. Label it.

---

## 4.1.1 Structure of the atom :atom_symbol:

- state the approximate **radius** of an atom
- describe the basic **structure** of an atom
- state that the nuclear **radius** is approximately 1/10000 of the radius of an atom
- state that **electrons** are arranged at **different distances** from the nucleus
- describe how **absorption** and **emission** of **electromagnetic radiation** causes changes to electron energies

# The word **atom**

Comes from the **ancient greek** atomos meaning **indivisible**.

---

# Reminder: Standard form

- 1 m is written as $1 \times 10^0$ m
- 0.1 m becomes $1 \times 10^{-1}$ m
- 0.01 becomes $1 \times 10^{-2}$ m (1cm)

:memo: write 1 mm in standard form
:memo: write $1 \times 10^{-10}$ as a normal decimal

# Atoms are small :atom_symbol:

- Imagine a strawberry :strawberry:...
- Blown up to the size of the **Earth** :earth_africa:
- The **atoms** are now strawberry size! :scream_cat: :exploding_head:

Atomic radius is $\approx 10^{-10}$ m (one ten-billionth of a metre!).

---

## The nucleus is even smaller

Like a speck of dust in Wembley stadium!

$\approx 10^{-15}$ m

# [Powers of ten](https://youtu.be/44cv416bKP4?feature=shared&t=368)

Watch the [video](https://youtu.be/44cv416bKP4?feature=shared&t=368), thinking about:

- How small is an atom? :atom_symbol:
- How small is a nucleus? :radioactive:
- How much smaller is the nucleus than the atom?

# Structure of the atom

- the number of electrons = number of protons for a **neutral atom**
- If they are not, it is called an **ion**

# What are particles?

- Particles have **charge** and **mass**
- What force acts on **mass**?
- What force acts on **charge**?

---

## Relative charges and masses

| particle | relative mass | relative charge |
| -------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| proton   | +1            | +1              |
| neutron  | +1            | 0               |
| electron | 1/2000        | -1              |

Nb: AQA allows you to consider the electron as having a _very small_ or _negligible_ mass.

# A neutron walks into a bar... :laughing:

# Electrons

- electrons are at different **distances** from the nucleus
- the further they are, the **more energy** they have

---

# Gaining and losing energy

- electrons can **gain** energy by absorbing **electromagnetic radiation** usually in the form of:
  - infra-red
  - visible
  - ultraviolet
- but this tends to be lost very quickly, and **re-emitted**

What could happen to an electron if it absorbs a **lot** of energy?

---

# Fast recall

Get ready :+1:

---

# Which particles are in the nucleus?

---

# Which particle in the atom is **negatively** charged?

---

# What is the relative charge of the electron?

---

# What happens to atomic electrons if they absorb energy?

---

# Name a part of the electromagnetic spectrum that atomic electrons tend to absorb.

---

# What is the approximate atomic radius in metres?
