## 4.1.3 The development of the model of the atom

- State that scientific ideas develop and change in the light of new experimental evidence.
- Describe the development of the model of the atom
- Explain why the new evidence from the scattering experiment led to a change in the atomic model.
- Compare the plum pudding and the nuclear model of the atom.

# Why was the plum pudding model discarded?

1. Because most alpha particles passed straight through the atom
2. Because most alpha particles bounced straight back
3. Because a few alpha particles bounced straight back
4. Because a few alpha particles passed straight through
