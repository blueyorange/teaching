## 4.1.3 The development of the model of the atom


- State that scientific ideas develop and change in the light of new experimental evidence.
- Describe the development of the model of the atom from tiny indivisible spheres to the plum pudding model, then the Rutherford nuclear and the Bohr model
- Explain why the new evidence from the scattering experiment led to a change in the atomic model.
- Compare the plum pudding and the nuclear model of the atom.
