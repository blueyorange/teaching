## 4.1.3 The development of the model of the atom

- State that scientific ideas develop and change in the light of new experimental evidence.
- Describe the development of the model of the atom
- Explain why the new evidence from the scattering experiment led to a change in the atomic model.
- Compare the plum pudding and the nuclear model of the atom.

# What is a model?

A model is a picture we have which helps us to understand what is going on.

# Democritus

- All matter made of **indivisible** spheres.

### Development of the atomic model

| Model   | New evidence                    | Changes to model                                 |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Dalton  | Discovery of chemical elements. | Atoms are different for different elements only. |
| Thomson | Discovery of...                 | Atom not ...                                     |

# Why was the plum pudding model discarded?

1. Because most alpha particles passed straight through the atom
2. Because most alpha particles bounced straight back
3. Because a few alpha particles bounced straight back
4. Because a few alpha particles passed straight through

# Exam question (6 marks)

Scientists sometimes replace one scientific model with a different model.

For example, in the early 20th Century the plum pudding model of the atom was replaced by the nuclear model of the atom.

**Explain what led to the plum pudding model of the atom being replaced by the nuclear model of the atom.**

#### Mark scheme (1 mark each point) :couple:

- alpha particle scattering experiment
- alpha particles directed at gold foil
- most alpha particles pass straight through
- (so) most of atom is empty space
- a few alpha particles deflected through large angles
- (so) mass is concentrated at centre of atom
- (and) nucleus is (positively) charged
- plum pudding model has mass spread throughout atom
- plum pudding model has charge spread throughout atom
