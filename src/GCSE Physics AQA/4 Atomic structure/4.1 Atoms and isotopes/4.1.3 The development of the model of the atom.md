## 4.1.3 The development of the model of the atom

- State that scientific ideas develop and change in the light of new experimental evidence.
- Describe the development of the model of the atom
- Explain why the new evidence from the scattering experiment led to a change in the atomic model.
- Compare the plum pudding and the nuclear model of the atom.

What can this idea explain?
What can it **not** explain?

### How can we compare models?

| observations  | model X            | model Y            |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| observation A | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| observation B | :x:                | :white_check_mark: |

#### Should we use model X or Y?

# Task

1. Use the coloured information sheet to come up with 3 bullet points for each model of the atom.

2. Annotate the arrows to show why the previous model was abandoned for the next one.

# Dalton's model of the atom

- indivisible spheres
- different for different chemical elements
- explains why reactions are in fixed ratios

---

# Thomson's model of the atom

## The 'plum-pudding' model

- discovery of the electron
- sphere of positive charge
- electrons dotted inside

---

# Rutherford model

## The nuclear model

- small dense positive nucleus
- electrons orbit

### Match the statement to the model

- atoms are indivisible
- revealed by alpha scattering experiment
- alpha particles deflected by nucleus
- positive charge spread around atom
- prompted by discovery of electron
- small dense positive nucleus
- electrons arranged at different distance from the nucleus

## &alpha; particle Scattering Experiment

| observation                                                      | Thomson            | Rutherford         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| most alpha particles pass through atom with no/small deflections | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| a few deflect at large angles                                    | :x:                | :white_check_mark: |

<!-- _class: multi-choice -->

#### Why was the plum pudding model discarded?

1. Because most alpha particles passed straight through the atom
2. Because most alpha particles bounced straight back
3. Because a few alpha particles bounced straight back
4. Because a few alpha particles passed straight through

# Exam question (6 marks)

Scientists sometimes replace one scientific model with a different model.

For example, in the early 20th Century the plum pudding model of the atom was replaced by the nuclear model of the atom.

**Explain what led to the plum pudding model of the atom being replaced by the nuclear model of the atom.**

#### Mark scheme (1 mark each point) :couple:

- alpha particle scattering experiment
- alpha particles directed at gold foil
- most alpha particles pass straight through
- (so) most of atom is empty space
- a few alpha particles deflected through large angles
- (so) mass is concentrated at centre of atom
- (and) nucleus is (positively) charged
- plum pudding model has mass spread throughout atom
- plum pudding model has charge spread throughout atom
