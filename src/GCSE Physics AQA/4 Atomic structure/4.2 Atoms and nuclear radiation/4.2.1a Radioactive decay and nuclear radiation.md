## 4.2.1 Radioactive decay and nuclear radiation

- State the origin of nuclear radiation as instability in the atomic nucleus.
- Describe the random nature of radioactive decay
- State the definition of activity and the unit (becquerel - Bq)
- Use the idea of count rate and link to activity

# :radioactive: What is radioactivity?

An **unstable** atomic nucleus undergoes **radioactive decay**.

---

# What makes an atomic nucleus unstable?

Some **isotopes** are **unstable**, and some are not.

### Example

**carbon 12** is **stable**, but **carbon** 14 is radioactive.

---

# Radioactive decay is **random**

We cannot predict when an atomic nucleus will decay.
