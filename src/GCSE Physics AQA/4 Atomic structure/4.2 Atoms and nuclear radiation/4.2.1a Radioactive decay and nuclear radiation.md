# :blue_book: Do it now! (please) :smiley:

1. Name one type of ionising radiation.
2. Name one particle in the nucleus of the atom.
3. Give the relative charge of the electron.
4. Give the relative mass of the electron.
5. Give two differences between the **plum pudding** model and the **nuclear model** of the atom.

# 4 Atomic structure

## 4.2 Atoms and nuclear radiation

### 4.2.1 Radioactive decay and nuclear radiation

---

## Learning Objectives

- State the origin of n**uclear radiation** as **instability** in the atomic **nucleus**.
- Describe the **random** nature of radioactive decay
- State the definition of activity and the unit (becquerel - Bq)
- Use the idea of **count rate** and link to **activity**

# True or false? :couple: :speaking_head:

## :radioactive: Radioactivity...

1.  It is to do with _radio waves_.
2.  It is _harmless_.
3.  It is produced by the atomic _nucleus_.
4.  Exposure to radiation makes things radioactive.
5.  It is is all around us.

# 1. :red_circle: Radioactivity is to do with radio waves

No it isn't.

---

# 2. :orange_circle: Radioactivity is harmless

- at low levels, yes :sunglasses:.
- at high levels, no :skull_and_crossbones:. It is **ionising radiation**.

---

# 3. :green_circle: Radioactivity is produced by the atomic nucleus

---

# 4. :red_circle: Exposure to radiation makes things radioactive.

---

# 5. :green_circle: Radioactivity is all around us.

Food :banana:, rocks :rock:, and air :wind_face: all have small amounts of radioactive material.

# What happens during radioactive decay?

- An atomic **nucleus** releases a **particle** of radiation (alpha, beta, or gamma).
- The **atomic number** or **mass number** might change.
- The new nucleus could be **stable** or **unstable**.

---

## What makes an atomic nucleus unstable?

Some **isotopes** are **unstable**, and some are **not**.

### Example

**Carbon 12** is **stable**, but **carbon 14** is radioactive.

---

# Radioactive decay is **random** :game_die:

- We _cannot_ predict when an atomic nucleus will decay.
- We _can_ predict what proportion of a large sample of atoms will decay in a given time.

---

# What is **activity**?

> The **activity** of a radioactive source is the **total** amount of radiation given off **per second**.

- It is measured in **becquerels** (Bq).
- One becquerel is equivalent to one count per second.

---

# How do we measure radioactivity?

- We use a radiation detector (a Geiger-Muller or GM tube is one example).
- It measures **count rate**.
- **Count** rate is proportional to **activity**.

---

### Demonstration: Detecting radiation

:warning: Radioactive materials must be handled with care and ONLY BY A TEACHER.
