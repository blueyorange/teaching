## Learning Objectives

- State the origin of **nuclear radiation** as **instability** in the atomic **nucleus**.
- Describe the **random** nature of radioactive decay
- State the definition of activity and the unit (becquerel - Bq)
- Use the idea of **count rate** and link to **activity**

# True or false? :couple: :speaking_head:

## :radioactive: Radioactivity...

1.  It is to do with _radio waves_.
2.  It is _harmless_.
3.  It is produced by the atomic _nucleus_.
4.  Exposure to radiation makes things radioactive.
5.  It is all around us.

---

# 1. :red_circle: Radioactivity is to do with radio waves

No it isn't.

---

# 2. :orange_circle: Radioactivity is harmless

- at low levels, yes :sunglasses:.
- at high levels or over long periods of time, no :skull_and_crossbones:. It is **ionising radiation**.

# 3. :green_circle: Radioactivity is produced by the atomic nucleus

---

# 4. :red_circle: Exposure to radiation makes things radioactive.

No. It's not a virus. :mask:

---

# 5. :green_circle: Radioactivity is all around us.

Food :banana:, rocks :rock:, and air :wind_face: all have small amounts of radioactive material.

# Radioactivity

...is used to describe the effects of **nuclear radiation**.

---

# What happens during radioactive decay?

- An atomic **nucleus** releases a **particle** of radiation (alpha, beta, or gamma).
- The **atomic number** or **mass number** might change.
- The new nucleus could be **stable** or **unstable**.

---

## What makes an atomic nucleus unstable?

Some **isotopes** are **unstable**, and some are **not**.

### Example

**Carbon 12** is **stable**, but **carbon 14** is radioactive.

---

# Radioactive decay is **random** :game_die:

- We _cannot_ predict when an atomic nucleus will decay.
- We _can_ predict what proportion of a large sample of atoms will decay in a given time.

---

# What is **activity**?

> The **activity** of a radioactive source is the **total** amount of radiation given off **per second**.

- It is measured in **becquerels** (Bq).
- One becquerel is equivalent to one count per second.

---

# How do we measure radioactivity?

- We use a radiation detector (a Geiger-Muller or GM tube is one example).
- It measures **count rate**.
- **Count rate** is proportional to **activity**.

---

# Why is nuclear radiation hazardous? :radioactive:

- the particles produced have very **high energy**
- it is **ionising** radiation
- it can lead to cell damage/cancer in high enough doses

---

### Demonstration: Detecting radiation

:warning: Radioactive materials must be handled with care and ONLY BY A TEACHER.

### :green_circle: Nuclear Radiation

1. Where does **nuclear radiation** come from?
2. What does *unstable* mean, applied to an atomic nucleus?
3. What is meant by an **unstable isotope**?
4. What do we mean by **activity** of a radioactive source?
5. Is a source with higher **activity** potentially more or less harmful than a source with a lower activity?
6. What happens to the **activity** of a radioactive source over time?

---

### :orange_circle: Nuclear Radiation

7. What is a **becquerel**? What have becquerels got to do with the unit of frequency?
8. Identify a similarity and difference between **count rate** and **activity**.
9. There are 82 elements from hydrogen to lead. Only 80 are found naturally. Why?
10. Draw an experimental setup for measuring the count rate of a radioactive source
