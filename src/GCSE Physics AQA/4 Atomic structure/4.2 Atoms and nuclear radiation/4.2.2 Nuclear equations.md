## 4.2.2 Nuclear equations

### Learning Objectives

- Write or complete nuclear equations for alpha and beta decay.
- State that the nucleus remains unchanged upon the release of a gamma ray.

---

# Strontium 90

Strontium-90 is a **beta-emitter**.

- In the 1950s, lots of nuclear weapons testing was carried out.
- This led to lots of strontium-90 in the atmosphere.
- This could have led to many people getting disease as a result - but we don't know for sure.

---

# Beta Decay

A **neutron** changes into a **proton** and a **beta particle**.

## Example

Strontium-90 decays into yttrium-90.

$$^{90}_{38}\text{Sr} \rightarrow ^{90}_{39}\text{Y} + _{-1}^0\beta$$

- the electron has a **mass number** of **zero**
- the proton number increases by 1
- the mass number doesn't change

---

# Alpha decay

## Example

Bismuth 209 decays via alpha decay to tellurium 205.

$$\ce{^{209}_{83}\text{Bi}} \rightarrow ^{205}_{81}\text{Tl} + ^4_2\alpha$$

- the mass number of the element decreases by 4.
- the atomic number decreases by 2.

---

# Gamma Decay

During gamma decay there is **no change** to the nucleus.

The gamma particle has no charge and no mass.
