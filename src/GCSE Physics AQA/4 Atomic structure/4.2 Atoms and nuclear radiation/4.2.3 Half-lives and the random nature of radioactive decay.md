# :blue_book: Do It Now :raised_hands:

1. Name a type of radioactive decay that keeps the mass number the same.
2. State the unit of electrical resistance.
3. Give one difference between the particles in a solid and the particles in a liquid.
4. Name Thomson's model of the atom.
5. State the approximate range of alpha particles in air.

## 4.2.3 Half-lives

- explain the concept of half-life and how it is related to the random nature of radioactive decay.
- Determine the half-life of a radioactive isotope from given information.
- _Calculate the net decline, expressed as a ratio, in a radioactive emission after a given number of half-lives._

## Radioactive decay is **random**

Get yourself a die! :game_die:

You are undecayed atoms.
Each turn we all roll **once**.
If you roll a *6*, you have **decayed**. You can sit down.
How many undecayed atoms do we have at the end of each round?
