## 4.3.1 Background radiation


- State the meaning of **background radiation**
- Identify and list **sources** of background radiation
- Understand that people in different locations or occupations may experience **different levels** of background radiation
- The unit of radiation dose is the _sievert_ (Sv)

# Safe handling of radioactive sources

- Watch the demonstration, and write down any **safety precautions** used in the handling and storage of the radioactive source.
- Do these precautions help to prevent irradiation, contamination, or both?

# Safety Precautions

## How many did you get?

* kept in a sealed container (contamination)
* **lead-lined** container (irradiation)
* use of mat (contamination)
* tongs to increase distance (irradiation)
* minimise exposure time (irradiation)
* gloves (contamination)
* source holder

## Did I miss any out?
