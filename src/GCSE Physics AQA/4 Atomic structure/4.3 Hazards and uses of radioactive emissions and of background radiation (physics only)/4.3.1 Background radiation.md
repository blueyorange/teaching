## 4.3.1 Background radiation

- _State_ the meaning of **background radiation**
- _Identify_ and list **sources** of background radiation
- _Understand_ that people in different locations or occupations may experience **different levels** of background radiation
- _State_ that the unit of radiation dose is the _sievert_ (Sv)

# Background radiation
> Radiation that exists around us all the time.

It can come from **natural** or **artificial** sources.

# Unit of radiation dose

The unit of radiation dose is the **sievert (Sv)**.

source of exposure | dose / mSv
 --- | --- 
Dental x-ray	| 0.005 mSv
100g of Brazil nuts	| 0.01 
UK annual average dose | 2.7
sickness | 1000
probable death if received < one month| 5000

# Calculating your annual dose

Use the [worksheet](https://spark.iop.org/sites/default/files/media/documents/Background%20radiation%20-%20measuring%20your%20annual%20dose.pdf) to help you calculate your annual dose.

Some help:
- Wellington is about 100m above sea level.
- We are not near any power stations (although if you're a boarder you might be at home!)

# Copy and complete

1. Most background radiation is _gamma_ because...
2. Three occupations that may cause a higher annual dose are **air crew** because ... and also ... because ... and also ... because ... .
