## 4.3.1 Background radiation

- _State_ the meaning of **background radiation**
- _Identify_ and list **sources** of background radiation
- _Understand_ that people in different locations or occupations may experience **different levels** of background radiation
- _State_ that the unit of radiation dose is the _sievert_ (Sv)

# Demonstration: radiation detector with no source

## The radiation detector is able to detect radiation even with no source present.

This is called **background radiation.**

Where does it come from?

---

# Background radiation
> Radiation that exists around us all the time.

![bg right](https://cdn.savemyexams.co.uk/cdn-cgi/image/w=1920,f=auto/uploads/2021/06/8.1.5-Background-Radiation-Chart.png)

It can come from **natural** or **artificial** sources.

# Unit of radiation dose

The unit of radiation dose is the **sievert (Sv)**.

source of exposure | dose / mSv
 --- | --- 
Dental x-ray	| 0.005 mSv
100g of Brazil nuts	| 0.01 
UK annual average dose | 2.7
sickness | 1000
probable death if received < one month| 5000
