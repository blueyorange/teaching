# :blue_book: Do It Now!

1. What particles are in the atomic **nucleus**?
2. Uranium has 92 protons. How many **neutrons** does uranium-236 have?
3. What things can happen to an **unstable** nucleus?
4. Uranium-238 has a **half-life** of 4.5 billion years. In a rock containing 400 uranium atoms, how many would be left after 9 billion years?

# 1932

- James Chadwick discovers the neutron
- work begins irradiating elements with neutrons

<!-- In 1931, Walther Bothe and Herbert Becker found that if alpha particle radiation from polonium fell on beryllium, boron, or lithium, an unusually penetrating radiation was produced. The radiation was not influenced by an electric field, so Bothe and Becker assumed it was gamma radiation.[29][30] The following year Irène Joliot-Curie and Frédéric Joliot-Curie in Paris showed that if this "gamma" radiation fell on paraffin, or any other hydrogen-containing compound, it ejected protons of very high energy.[31] Neither Rutherford nor James Chadwick at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge were convinced by the gamma ray interpretation.[32] Chadwick quickly performed a series of experiments that showed that the new radiation consisted of uncharged particles with about the same mass as the proton.[8][33][34] These particles were neutrons. Chadwick won the 1935 Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery.[2] -->

## Nuclear fission

> Nuclear _fission_ is when a large unstable nucleus splits into two fragments (_daughter nuclei_) and two or three _neutrons_.

---

## Spontaneous fission

> An unstable nucleus undergoes fission as a form of _radioactive decay_.

---

## Induced fission

> A neutron is absorbed, forming an unstable nucleus which then fissions.

---

# Chain reaction

- Neutrons produced in fission go on to produce further fissions
- Each fission produces further neutrons which cause still further fissions.

# Controlled chain reactions

- Only one neutron goes on to cause further fissions
- The rate of reaction remains constant
- The other two neutrons are _absorbed_
- In a **nuclear reactor** this occurs via control rods
