# :blue_book: Do It Now!

1. What particles are in the atomic **nucleus**?
2. Uranium has 92 protons. How many **neutrons** does uranium-236 have?
3. What things can happen to an **unstable** nucleus?
4. Uranium-238 has a **half-life** of 4.5 billion years. In a rock containing 400 uranium atoms, how many would be left after 9 billion years?

## 4.4.1 Nuclear fission

- state the meaning of nuclear **fission**
- explain **spontaneous** vs **induced** fission
- describe a **chain reaction**
- explain the difference between **controlled** & **uncontrolled** chain reactions
- draw/interpret diagrams showing **chain reactions**

## Nuclear fission

> Nuclear _fission_ is when a large unstable nucleus splits into two fragments (_daughter nuclei_) and two or three _neutrons_.

---

## Spontaneous fission

> An unstable nucleus undergoes fission as a form of _radioactive decay_.

- spontaneous fission tends to be very _slow_
- it can be used as a neutron source

---

## Induced fission

> A neutron is absorbed, forming an unstable nucleus which then fissions.

- induced fission is used to power nuclear fission **bombs** and **nuclear reactors**

---

# Chain reaction

- Neutrons produced in fission go on to produce further fissions
- Each fission produces further neutrons which cause still further fissions.

# Controlled chain reactions

- Only one neutron goes on to cause further fissions
- The rate of reaction remains constant
- The other two neutrons are _absorbed_
- In a **nuclear reactor** this occurs via control rods

# Nuclear reactors

- most use _uranium 235_ as fuel
- _control rods_ are used to absorb neutrons
- _moderator_ is used to control neutron speed
