## 4.4.1 Nuclear fission

- Describe nuclear _fission_ as the splitting of a large and unstable nucleus (eg uranium or plutonium)
- Spontaneous vs induced fission
- Splitting into two smaller nuclei plus two or three neutrons
- the idea of a _chain reaction_
- controlled vs uncontrolled chain reactions
- draw/interpret diagrams representing nuclear fission and how a chain reaction may occur

# Nuclear power

- Nuclear power is an important _energy resource_
- 10% of global energy
- second largest low carbon source

## Nuclear fission

> Nuclear _fission_ is when a large unstable nucleus splits into two fragments (_daughter nuclei_) and two or three _neutrons_.

## Spontaneous fission

> An unstable nucleus undergoes fission as a form of _radioactive decay_.

## Induced fission

> A neutron is absorbed, forming an unstable nucleus which then fissions.

---

# Chain reaction

- Neutrons produced in fission go on to produce further fissions
- Each fission produces further neutrons which cause still further fissions.

# Controlled chain reactions

- Only one neutron goes on to cause further fissions
- The rate of reaction remains constant
- The other two neutrons are _absorbed_
- In a **nuclear reactor** this occurs via control rods

# Nuclear reactors

- most use _uranium 235_ as fuel
- _control rods_ are used to absorb neutrons
- _moderator_ is used to control neutron speed
