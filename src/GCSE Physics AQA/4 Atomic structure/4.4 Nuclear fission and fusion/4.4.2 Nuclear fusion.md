## 4.4.2 Nuclear fusion


- Nuclear fusion is the joining of two light nuclei to form a heavier nucleus.
- In this process some of the mass may be converted into the energy of radiation.

# Star power

- nuclear **fusion** is the process which powers our Sun, and all stars
- we have created **fusion bombs** which harness this power in an **uncontrolled** way
- we are working on harnessing its power to generate **clean, sustainable** energy

# Mass and energy

- Einstein's **theory of special relativity** stated that mass and energy are **equivalent**

$$E=mc^2$$

# Nuclear fusion

- fusion reactions require temperatures of **100 million degrees C!**
- lighter nuclei fuse to form heavier nuclei
- the mass of the products is **smaller** than the mass of the reactants
- the difference becomes **energy**

# Nuclear fusion today

- this is an experimental nuclear reactor called a **tokamak**
- recently scientists managed to achieve a breakthrough - more energy out than in
- this has taken 60 years of work!
- the difficulty is in containing the **plasma** as it is very hot!

# Stretch and challenge questions

1)	What is Einsteinâ€™s famous equation?  Write the equation and explain what each letter stands for.

2)	Explain how splitting an atom of uranium can lead to a chain reaction.

3)	If a nuclear core melts down, it gets so hot that it can melt the rock beneath it and start sinking into the Earth.  If an American reactor melts down, what is to stop it melting all the way through to China?

4)	Why do we need a critical mass of uranium to ensure the reaction gets going?  What will happen if there is less than the critical mass of uranium?

---

5)	What happens if the mass of uranium involved in a fission reaction is smaller than a tennis ball?

6)	Explain why the temperature for the fusion of hydrogen nuclei has to be so high.

7)	Using your answer to question 6 explain why we struggle to control and initiate a fusion reaction in a laboratory.
