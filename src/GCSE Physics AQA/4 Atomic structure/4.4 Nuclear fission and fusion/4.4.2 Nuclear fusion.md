## 4.4.2 Nuclear fusion


- Nuclear fusion is the joining of two light nuclei to form a heavier nucleus.
- In this process some of the mass may be converted into the energy of radiation.

# Star power

- nuclear **fusion** is the process which powers our Sun, and all stars
- we have created **fusion bombs** which harness this power in an **uncontrolled** way
- we are working on harnessing its power to generate **clean, sustainable** energy

# Mass and energy

- Einstein's **theory of special relativity** stated that mass and energy are **equivalent**

$$E=mc^2$$

# Nuclear fusion

- lighter nuclei fuse to form heavier nuclei
- the mass of the products (helium) is less thatn the total mass of the initial nuclei (hydrogen)
- the difference becomes **energy**
