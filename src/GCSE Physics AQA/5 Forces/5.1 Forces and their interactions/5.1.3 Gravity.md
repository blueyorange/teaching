## 5.1.3 Gravity


- Weight is the force acting on an object due to gravity.
- The force of gravity close to the Earth is due to the gravitational field around the Earth.
- The weight of an object depends on the gravitational field strength at the point where the object is.
- Calculate weight using $W = mg$.
- Concept of 'centre of mass', which is a **point** where weight may be considered to act.
- Weight and mass are _directly proportional_
- Weight can be measured using a calibrated _spring-balance_ (a _newtonmeter_)
