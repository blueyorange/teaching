## 5.1.4 Resultant forces


- Concept of _resultant force_ as a single equivalent force
- Calculate the resultant of two forces that act in a straight line.
- _Describe examples of the forces acting on an isolated object or system_
- _Use free body diagrams to describe qualitatively examples where several forces lead to a resultant force on an object_
- _Resolve a single force into two components acting at right angles to each other. The two component forces together have the same effect as the single force_
- _Use vector diagrams to illustrate resolution of forces, equilibrium situations and determine the resultant of two forces, to include both magnitude and direction (scale drawings only)_
