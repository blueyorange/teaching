## 5.3.1 Elastic forces


- give examples of the forces involved in stretching, bending or compressing an object
- explain why, to change the shape of an object (by stretching, bending or compressing), more than one force has to be applied â€“ this is limited to stationary objects only
- describe the difference between elastic deformation and inelastic deformation caused by stretching forces.
- use the equation $F=ke$ for tension or compression
- calculate the work done in stretching using the equation $E_e = \frac{1}{2}ke^2$
- **Required practical activity 6**: investigate the relationship between force and extension for a spring.
