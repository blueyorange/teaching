## 5.5.1 Pressure in a fluid (HT)


- A _fluid_ can be either a liquid or a gas.
- The pressure in fluids causes a force normal (at right angles) to any surface.
- The pressure at the surface can be calculated using the equation $p = \frac{F}{A}$
- Calculate the pressure due to a column of liquid using $p = h \rho g$
- Explain why, in a liquid, pressure at a point increases with the height of the column of liquid above that point and with the density of the liquid
- Calculate differences in pressure
- Explain how _upthrust_ is caused by pressure differences
- Describe the factors which affect floating and sinking
