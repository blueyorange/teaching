# 5 Forces

## 5.6 Forces and motion

### 5.6.1.5 Terminal velocity

---

# Starter

## Choose the correct equation!

1. A ball rolls down a ramp, increasing its speed from 1 m/s to 5 m/s in 5s. Calculate the acceleration.
2. Another ball rolls down a ramp, increasing its speed from 3 m/s to 4 m/s and covering 1 m. Calculate the acceleration.

---

# Solutions

1.  $$
    a = \frac{v-u}{t} = \frac{5-1}{4} = 0.8 \text{ m/s}^2
    $$
2.  $$
    \begin{aligned}
    v^2 &= u^2 + 2as \\
    (4)^2 &= (3)^2 + 2a(1) \\
    16 &= 9 + 2a \\
    a &= 3.5 \text{ m/s}^2
    \end{aligned}
    $$

## 5.6.1.5 Terminal velocity

- **state** that objects in free fall have an acceleration of 9.8 m/s$^2$
- **draw** and **interpret** velocityâ€“time graphs for objects that reach terminal velocity
- **interpret** the changing motion in terms of the forces acting

# Crumpled vs flat paper

Which will hit the ground first?

Why?

# Free fall

A freely falling object moves only under the influence of **gravity**.

All objects in free fall have the same **acceleration**: 9.81 m/s$^2$.

# Galileo's Experiment

![bg left fit](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Pisa_experiment.png)

Two balls, one heavy, one light.

Both hit the ground at the same time, **if air resistance is not significant**.

# Crumpled paper again

- crumpled paper is effectively in free fall
- the flat paper rapidly reaches a terminal (final) speed

# Skydiving

Watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EabUUrZFnFE) and record the velocity, maybe every 2 seconds.

Plot a **velocity-time graph**.

Mark on it:

- leaving the plane
- reaching terminal velocity
- opening the parachute

How do the forces on the parachutist change at each stage.
Can you **calculate** the distance covered?

# Key explanations

## Explain the changing motion of the skydiver in terms of the forces acting on the skydiver.

Initially the skydiver **accelerates** because...
Acceleration causes air resistance to...
Resultant force... so acceleration...
so the skydiver falls at **terminal velocity**.

## Explain what happens to velocity and acceleration during the fall of the skydiver, in each stage.

# Further questions

1. Explain the term 'terminal velocity', with reference to a cyclist freewheeling down a hill.
2. Would a heavier cyclist achieve a higher or lower terminal speed? Explain.
3. What would adopting a more aerodynamic position do to terminal speed? Explain.
4. Explain how the forces on a car driving with constant forward force lead to a constant speed.
5. Explain why a skiier sliding down a hill does not keep increasing their speed indefinitely.
6. How would skydiving from a much greater height affect the terminal velocity?
8. What are the energy changes (a) before (b) when terminal speed is reached.
