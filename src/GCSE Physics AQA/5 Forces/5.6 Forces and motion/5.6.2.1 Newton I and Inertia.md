## Newton's First Law and Inertia

- apply **Newtonâ€™s First Law** to explain the motion of objects moving with a uniform velocity and objects where the speed and/or direction changes
- (HT) The tendency of objects to continue in their state of rest or of uniform motion is called **inertia**

# Izzy space jump

Watch the [video](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/pixar/images/e/eb/Izzy_Hawthorne_render.jpeg/revision/latest?cb=20220920225930).

What forces were acting on Izzy?

Why doesn't she slow down?

# Newton's First Law

> Objects will remain **at rest** or in **uniform motion in a straight line** unless there is an **external resultant force**.

# Inertia and mass

## Inertia

> The tendency of an object to continue in a uniform state of motion.

- Mass has two different effects: **inertia** and **weight**.
- The bigger the **mass**, the greater the **inertia**.

# Work through the **forces and motion** examples.

# Further questions

1. Which has more inertia: a truck or a car? Explain.
2.

# How can astronauts measure mass in space?

Weighing scales do not work because there is too little gravity to cause **weight**.

Watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uaSOg4686g).

Try out the apparatus on your desks. Which hacksaw blade moves slower? Why?

# Football on the Moon

How would it be different if you kicked a football on the **Moon**, compared to Earth?

What about kicking a stone football?

_hint: use ideas about **weight** and **inertia**._

# Answers: football on the Moon.

- A football kicked on the moon with the same **force** would achieve the same initial speed, as it has the same **mass**.
- But it would go much further, as it has less **weight** to return it to ground.
- A **stone** football would hurt your foot just as much as on Earth!

# Plenary: slo-mo tennis ball

Watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yT0hxplVBg).

Think about the forces acting on the tennis ball _before_, _during_, and _after_ it hits the ground.

Complete the exit ticket **forces on a tin of beans**.
