## 5.6.2.2 Newton's Second Law


- $F = ma$ or $a = \frac{F}{m}$
- explain that inertial mass is a measure of how difficult it is to change the velocity of an object
- inertial mass is defined as the ratio of force over acceleration
- estimate the speed, accelerations and forces involved in large accelerations for everyday road transport
- recognise and be able to use the symbol that indicates an approximate value or approximate answer (&#126;)
<!-- - **Required practical activity 7**: investigate the effect of varying the force on the acceleration of an object of constant mass, and the effect of varying the mass of an object on the acceleration produced by a constant force. -->
