## 5.6.2.2 Newton's Second Law


- $F = ma$ or $a = \frac{F}{m}$
- explain that inertial mass is a measure of how difficult it is to change the velocity of an object
- inertial mass is defined as the ratio of force over acceleration
- estimate the speed, accelerations and forces involved in large accelerations for everyday road transport
- recognise and be able to use the symbol that indicates an approximate value or approximate answer (&#126;)
<!-- - **Required practical activity 7**: investigate the effect of varying the force on the acceleration of an object of constant mass, and the effect of varying the mass of an object on the acceleration produced by a constant force. -->

# Two effects of mass

## Inertia
- how difficult it is to **change velocity**

## Gravitational
- mass causes **weight**

**Newton's laws of motion** refer to the **inertia** caused by mass.
**Newton's law of gravity** refers to the **weight** caused by mass.

# Newton's Laws

## Newton's first law of motion
> An object with zero resultant force will be at rest or move in a straight line at constant speed.

## Newton's second law of motion
> Force equals mass times acceleration.

$F=ma$ if force is in newtons, mass in kg, acceleration in ms$^{-2}$.

# Example

A car of mass 900 kg has a forward force of 500 N and a resistive force of 50 N. Calculate the acceleration.

## Solution

1. Calculate the resultant force: $F = 500-50= 450 \text{ N}$.
2. Calculate the acceleration.
$$
\begin{align}
F&=ma\\
450 &=900 \times a \\
a &=\frac{450}{900} \\
&= 0.5 \text{ ms}^{-2}
\end{align}
$$
