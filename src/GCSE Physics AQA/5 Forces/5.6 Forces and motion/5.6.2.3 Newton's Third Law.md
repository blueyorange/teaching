# What is Newton's third law?

Commonly stated as

> _Every action has an equal and opposite reaction._

---

# Newton's third law

> _When two bodies exert forces on each other, the forces are **equal** and **opposite**, and are of the **same type**._

# Newton's Third Law: Questions

1. State **Newton's third law**.
2. Do forces always act in pairs? If not, can you think of a counter-example?
3. Give three examples of Newton's third law force pairs. e.g. _if I push on bicycle pedals, the pedals push back on my feet. This is a contact force_
4. Why do guns and cannons _recoil_ when fired?
5. A book sits on a table. A normal reaction force pushes up. Its weight pulls it down. The forces are equal. Give two reasons why these forces do _not_ form a Newton III force-pair.
6. Explain how a _rocket_ works in terms of Newton's Third Law.
