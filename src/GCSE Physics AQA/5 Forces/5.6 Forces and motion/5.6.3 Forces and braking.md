## 5.6.3 Forces and braking

- relate work done by the friction force to the loss in kinetic energy and the rise in temperature of the brakes
- relate the speed to braking force required for same braking distance
- explain the dangers caused by large decelerations
- (HT only) estimate the forces involved in the deceleration of road vehicles in typical situations on a public road

# Stopping distance
> The time taken between seeing the obstruction and stopping.

## Thinking distance
> Time between seeing the obstruction and applying the brakes.

## Braking distance
> Time between applying the brakes and stopping.

**Stopping distance = Thinking distance + Braking distance**

---

# Thinking distance
> Time between seeing the obstruction and applying the brakes.

Thinking distance is related to **reaction time**.

## Factors affecting thinking distance
* speed
* tiredness
* drugs and alchohol
* distractions

---

# Braking distance
> Time between applying the brakes and stopping.

## Factors affecting braking distance
* speed
* condition of road
* condition of tyres
* weather e.g. icy conditions

# Braking distance and energy

kinetic energy **store** $\rightarrow$ thermal energy **store**

- **work** is done against **friction** during stopping
- temperature of the brakes **rises**
- brakes can **overheat**

The faster a vehicle travels:
- the longer it takes to stop OR
- the more force is required to stop it in the same distance

# Calculating thinking distance

A car travels at 15 m/s. If the reaction time is 0.2 s, calculate the thinking distance.

$$
\begin{align}
\text{speed} &= \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}} \\
v &= \frac{s}{t} \\
15 &= \frac{s}{0.2} \\
s &= 15 \times 0.2 \\
s &= 3.0 \text{ m}
\end{align}
$$
