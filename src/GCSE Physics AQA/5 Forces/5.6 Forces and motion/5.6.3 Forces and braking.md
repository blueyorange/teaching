## 5.6.3 Forces and braking

- relate work done by the friction force to the loss in kinetic energy and the rise in temperature of the brakes
- relate the speed to braking force required for same braking distance
- explain the dangers caused by large decelerations
- (HT only) estimate the forces involved in the deceleration of road vehicles in typical situations on a public road
