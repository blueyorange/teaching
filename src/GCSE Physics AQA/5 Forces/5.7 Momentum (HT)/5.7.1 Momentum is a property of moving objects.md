## 5.7.1 Momentum is a property of moving objects

- Define momentum as $p=mv$
- State the principle of conservation of momentum
- describe and explain examples of momentum in an event, such as a collision
- (physics only) complete calculations involving an event, such as the collision of two objects.

# Momentum is a property of moving objects

- Stationary objects have **zero momentum**.
- Objects with a large **mass** and a large **velocity** have lots of momentum.
- A large force is required to produce a large **change in momentum**.

# Momentum

> Momentum = mass x velocity

$$p=mv$$

- $p$ momentum $\text{kg m/s}$ or $\text{Ns}$
- $m$ mass in $\text{kg}$
- $v$ speed or velocity in $\text{m/s}$

Momentum is a **vector** quantity - it has **magnitude** and **direction**.
Momentum is **conserved** - the total momentum of a **closed system** never changes.

# Example: Calculating momentum

A 60 kg person travels on a 15 kg bike at a speed of 15 m/s. Calculate the momentum of the person and bicycle.

## Solution

1. Find the total mass.
   $$m = 60+15 = 75 \text{ kg}$$

2. Calculate the momentum.
   $$p = mv = 75 \times 15 = 1125 \text{ kg m/s} $$

# Example 2: Calculating momentum

A bullet leaves a gun with a momentum of $2.4 \text{ kg m/s}$.
Calculate the mass of the bullet **in grams** if it has a muzzle velocity of $120 \text{ m/s}$.

## Solution

$$
\begin{align}
p &=mv \\
2.4 &= m \times 120 \\
m &= \frac{2.4}{120} \\
&= 0.02 \text{ kg} \\
& = 0.02 \times 1000 \text{g}\\
&= 20 \text{ g}
\end{align}
$$

# Momentum vs. Kinetic Energy

## What are the similarities and differences?

- both depend on **mass** and **velocity**
  but...
- momentum is **vector**, kinetic energy is **scalar**
- different formulae, ke $\propto v^2$, but $p \propto v$
- momentum is always conserved. As kinetic energy can be converted into other forms, it is not always conserved (but energy always is!)

# The principle of conservation of momentum

> The total momentum before a collision is the same as the total momentum after.

During a collision, momentum can be transferred from one object to another, but the _total_ momentum remains the same.

There are two main examples of collision questions.

- In a _sticky_ collision, two objects collide and then move off together (e.g. two ice hockey players colliding)
- In an _explosion_ the momentum is _zero_. For example, a bullet from a gun.

# Example: _Sticky_ collisions

A car with a mass of 800 kg is traveling at a speed of 20 m/s. Another car with a mass of 1200 kg is traveling in the opposite direction at a speed of 30 m/s. What is the final velocity of the two cars after they collide and stick together?

## Solution

1. Calculate the total momentum. Take care to watch for the _sign_ of the velocity.
   $$p = (1200 \times (30)) +  (800 \times (-20)) = 20,000 \text{ kg m/s}  $$
2. Total momentum does not change. So...
   $$
   \begin{align}
   p&=mv\\
   20,000 &= 2000 \times v \\
   v &= \frac{20,000}{2000} = 10 \text{ m/s}
   \end{align}
   $$

# Explosions

In an explosion, the **initial momentum = final momentum = _zero_**.

## Example

A bullet with a mass of 0.01 kg is fired from a gun with a velocity of 500 m/s. If the gun has a mass of 2 kg, what is the recoil velocity of the gun?

2. A hockey puck with a mass of 0.2 kg is moving with a velocity of 20 m/s. A player hits the puck with their stick, imparting a force of 50 N for a duration of 0.05 s. What is the final velocity of the puck?

3. A bullet with a mass of 0.01 kg is fired from a gun with a velocity of 500 m/s. If the gun has a mass of 2 kg, what is the recoil velocity of the gun?

4. Two carts with masses of 1 kg and 2 kg are moving in opposite directions, each with a velocity of 5 m/s. They collide and stick together. What is the final velocity of the combined carts?
