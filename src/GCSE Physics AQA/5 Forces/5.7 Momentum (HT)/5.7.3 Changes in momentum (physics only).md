## 5.7.3 Changes in momentum (physics only)

- Newton's second law as $F=\frac{m\Delta v}{\Delta t}$
- $m\Delta v$ as _change_ of momentum
- explain safety features such as: air bags, seat belts, gymnasium crash mats, cycle helmets and cushioned surfaces for playgrounds with reference to the concept of rate of change of momentum
- apply equations relating force, mass, velocity and acceleration to explain how the changes involved are inter-related.
