## 6.1.2 Properties of waves

- _amplitude_, _wavelength_, _frequency_, _period_
- $T = \frac{1}{f}$
- the wave equation $v=f \lambda$
- identify amplitude and wavelength from given diagrams
- describe a method to measure the speed of sound waves in air
- describe a method to measure the speed of ripples on a water surface

---

- (Physics only) Students should be able to show how changes in velocity, frequency and wavelength, in transmission of sound waves from one medium to another, are inter-related.

# Definitions

## Amplitude

> The maximum distance from the equilibrium position.

## Wavelength

> The distance for one full cycle of a wave.

---

# Period and frequency

## Period $T$

> The time taken for one complete cycle of a wave. Period is measured in _seconds_ (s).

## Frequency $f$

> The number of waves per second. Frequency is measure in _hertz_ (Hz).

Period and frequency are _inversely_ related.

$$f = \frac{1}{T}$$

1. Damping is... As the amount of damping increases, the amplitude....
2. This wave is _transverse/longitudinal_. I can tell because...
   Select **open end** and **oscillate**. Reduce the damping to **none**.
3. What happens to wavelength as frequency increases? Why?
4. Using the 'ruler' and 'stopwatch', is it possible it measure the speed of the waves? Try it.

5. Does the speed of the waves change as you increase the frequency? Try it. Copy and Complete the table below.

| Frequency / Hz | Wavelength / cm | Wave Speed / cm/s |
| -------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |

What is the relationship between wave speed, frequency, and wavelength?

### Extension

Wave speed can be affected by tension. What happens to the wave speed as the tension increases? Investigate!

# The wave speed equation

- wave speed = frequency x wavelength

$$v = f\lambda$$

- $v$: wave speed in m/s
- $f$: frequency in Hz
- $\lambda$ (lambda): wavelength in m

# Measuring speed of sound

1. Describe a method to measure the speed of sound waves in air
2. Describe a method to measure the speed of ripples on the water surface

# Describe a method to measure the speed of sound waves in air

- two people stand far apart (> 1km)
- one fires a pistol and raises a flag
- the other starts timing when the flag is raised
- stops timing when they hear a sound

---

# Describe a method to measure the speed of ripples on the water surface

- measure the distance between two buoys
- drop a stone into the water at one buoy and start the timer
- time how long it takes for the ripples to reach the other buoy
- use speed = distance / time to calculate the speed
