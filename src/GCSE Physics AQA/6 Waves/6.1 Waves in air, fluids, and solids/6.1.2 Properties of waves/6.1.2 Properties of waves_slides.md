- _amplitude_, _wavelength_, _frequency_, _period_
- $T = \frac{1}{f}$
- the wave equation $v=f \lambda$
- identify amplitude and wavelength from given diagrams
- describe a method to measure the speed of sound waves in air
- describe a method to measure the speed of ripples on a water surface
- (Physics only) Students should be able to show how changes in velocity, frequency and wavelength, in transmission of sound waves from one medium to another, are inter-related.
- **Required practical activity 8**: make observations to identify the suitability of apparatus to measure the frequency, wavelength and speed of waves in a ripple tank and waves in a solid and take appropriate measurements.
