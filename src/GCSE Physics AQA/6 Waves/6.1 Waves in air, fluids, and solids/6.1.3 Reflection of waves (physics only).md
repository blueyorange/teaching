## 6.1.3 Reflection of waves (physics only)


- construct ray diagrams to illustrate the reflection of a wave at a surface.
- describe the effects of reflection, transmission and absorption of waves at material interfaces.
- **Required practical activity 9** (physics only): investigate the reflection of light by different types of surface and the refraction of light by different substances.
