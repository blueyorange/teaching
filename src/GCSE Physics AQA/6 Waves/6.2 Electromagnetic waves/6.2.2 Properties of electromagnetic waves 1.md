## 6.2.2 Properties of electromagnetic waves 1

- (HT only) Different substances may absorb, transmit, refract or reflect electromagnetic waves in ways that vary with wavelength.
- (HT only) Some effects, for example refraction, are due to the difference in velocity of the waves in different substances.
- Students should be able to construct ray diagrams to illustrate the refraction of a wave at the boundary between two different media.
- (HT only) Students should be able to use wave front diagrams to explain refraction in terms of the change of speed that happens when a wave travels from one medium to a different medium.
