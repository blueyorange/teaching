## 6.3.1 Emission and absorption of infrared radiation

- explain that all bodies (objects) emit radiation
- that the intensity and wavelength distribution of any emission depends on the temperature of the body
- (HT) explain how the temperature of a body is related to the balance between incoming radiation absorbed and radiation emitted

---

# Key points

- All bodies emit and absorb infra-red radiation
- Black bodies are the best emitters (and absorbers) of radiation
- The temperature of a body is an equilibrium between energy emitted and energy absorbed

# Example: the Earth

![bg right:40%](https://d2pn8kiwq2w21t.cloudfront.net/original_images/jpegPIA22823.jpg)

- The Earth receives infra-red from the Sun
- The temperature of the Earth depends on how much is **reflected** and how much is **absorbed**
- Increased greenhouse gas levels mean it is absorbing **more** and reflecting **less**

# Questions

1. What did William Herschel set out to find out?
2. What did he find about the temperature of each of the colours?
3. What finding surprised him the most?
4. What did he discover?

## Next: Google 'PHeT black body radiation' and try the simulation!

# Questions on the simulation

1. What is the temperature of a light bulb?
2. Why does it appear reddy-orange, from the spectrum?
3. What happens to the visible light as the temperature is increased?
4. What happens to the total amount of light as the temperature is increased?
5. Describe and explain what will happen to the temperature of an object left in bright sunlight.

# Key Question

### Describe and explain what will happen to the temperature of an object left in bright sunlight.

- the Sun emits infra-red radiation
- the object will absorb infra-red radiation and its temperature will increase.
- as it gets hotter it emits more infra-red radiation
- an **equilibrium** is reached when emitted radiation = absorbed radiation
