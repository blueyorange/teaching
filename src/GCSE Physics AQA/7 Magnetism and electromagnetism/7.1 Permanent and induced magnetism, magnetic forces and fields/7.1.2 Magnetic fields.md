## 7.1.1 and 7.1.2 Magnetic fields

recall that:

- like poles repel, unlike poles attract
- magnets attract magnetic materials
- magnetic materials are iron, nickel, cobalt
- magnetic field lines point from **north** to **south**
- draw field line diagrams for different arrangements of magnetic poles
- state how field lines show **strength** and **direction** of a magnetic field
- _explain_ how the behaviour of a magnetic compass is related to evidence that the core of the Earth must be magnetic

- son of a bookbinder
- became assistant to Humphrey Davy
- little formal education
- researched electromagnetism, chemistry
- invented first electrical generator
- proposed 'lines of flux' towads end of life

# What do field lines show?

- _direction_ of force acting on a **North pole**
- _strength_ of field by spacing of lines

# Key question

## Describe how to plot a magnetic field using a plotting compass

- mark where the compass points on the paper
- move the compass to the marked point
- repeat until you go back to the magnet
- join up the points
- add an arrow pointing from the north pole to the south pole
- repeat for positions (above and below the bar magnet)
