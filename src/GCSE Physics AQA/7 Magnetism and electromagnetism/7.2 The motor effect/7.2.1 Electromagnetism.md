## 7.2.1 Electromagnetism

- describe how the **magnetic effect** of a current can be demonstrated
- draw the magnetic field pattern for a straight wire carrying a current and for a solenoid (showing the direction of the field)
- explain how a solenoid arrangement can increase the magnetic effect of the current

---

# Magnetic field around a wire

- use **right hand grip rule**
- thumb points in current direction, fingers show field direction
- field lines get **further apart**

# Describe how the magnetic effect of a current can be demonstrated

![bg right fit](https://www.exploratorium.edu/sites/default/files/CirclesMagnetism_DSC_9336_H1.jpg)

- vertical mounted wire
- arrange plotting compasses around wire

---

# Solenoid

> A type of **electromagnet** made from a long coil of wire.

# Field around a _solenoid_

- similar to bar magnet
- field lines extend inside

# Factors affecting the magnetic field around a solenoid

The diagram shows a cutaway view of an _electromagnet_.

- **current**
- number of **turns**
- use an **iron core**

# Questions

1. Copy and complete the diagrams by **adding arrows** to show the direction of the magnetic field around the two wires below. Use the right hand grip rule to determine this. The wire on the **left** has current moving **into** the board.

2. Describe how the diagrams show that the field is getting **weaker** with increased distance from each wire.

3. Copy and complete the diagram below to show the magnetic field lines around the solenoid. Use the **right hand grip rule**, with fingers aligning with the **current** direction, to determine the direction of the **magnetic field**.

4. Describe _three_ ways you could make the magnetic field stronger.
5. How would this change the field line diagram?

# Investigation

- You are to investigate how the **strength of an electromagnet** varies with either **current** or **number of turns**
- Strength can be measured in terms of **number of paperclips** picked up
- SAFETY: do not exceed 5A current
- Record results in a table

| number of turns | number of paperclips |
| --------------- | -------------------- |
| 5               | 1                    |
| ...             | ...                  |
