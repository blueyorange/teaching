## 7.2.1 Electromagnetism

- magnetic field around a wire
- describe how the magnetic effect of a current can be demonstrated
- draw the magnetic field pattern for a straight wire carrying a current and for a solenoid (showing the direction of the field)
- explain how a solenoid arrangement can increase the magnetic effect of the current

# Magnetic field around a wire

- use **right hand grip rule**
- thumb points in current direction, fingers show field direction
- field lines get **further apart**

# Describe how the magnetic effect of a current can be demonstrated

![bg right fit](https://www.exploratorium.edu/sites/default/files/CirclesMagnetism_DSC_9336_H1.jpg)

- vertical mounted wire
- arrange plotting compasses around wire

---

# Solenoid
> A wire wound into a coil shape.

# Electromagnet
> A solenoid with a current passed through it.

---

# Field around a _solenoid_

- similar to bar magnet
- field lines extend inside

# Factors affecting the magnetic field around a solenoid

* current
* number of turns
* use an **iron core**

---

# Investigation

- You are to investigate how the **strength of an electromagnet** varies with either **current** or **number of turns**
- Strength can be measured in terms of **number of paperclips** picked up
- SAFETY: do not exceed 5A current
- Record results in a table

number of turns | number of paperclips
--- | ---
5 | 1
... | ...

# Questions

1. Draw a solenoid. Show the direction of the current and the magnetic field lines.
2. Write down one way you could have improved the investigation you just carried out.
