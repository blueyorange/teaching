## 7.2.1 Electromagnetism

- describe how the magnetic effect of a current can be demonstrated
- draw the magnetic field pattern for a straight wire carrying a current and for a solenoid (showing the direction of the field)
- explain how a solenoid arrangement can increase the magnetic effect of the current

# Electromagnetism

Electric currents produce magnetic fields.
A magnet made using an electric current is called an _electromagnet_.

# Magnetic field around a wire

- use **right hand grip rule**
- thumb points in current direction, fingers show field direction
- field lines get **further apart**

- vertical mounted wire
- arrange plotting compasses around wire

---

# Solenoid

> A type of **electromagnet** made from a long coil of wire.

# Field around a _solenoid_

- similar to bar magnet
- field lines extend inside

# Factors affecting the magnetic field around a solenoid

The diagram shows a cutaway view of an _electromagnet_.

- **current**
- number of **turns**
- use an **iron core**

---

# Investigation

- You are to investigate how the **strength of an electromagnet** varies with either **current** or **number of turns**
- Strength can be measured in terms of **number of paperclips** picked up
- SAFETY: do not exceed 5A current
- Record results in a table

| number of turns | number of paperclips |
| --------------- | -------------------- |
| 5               | 1                    |
| ...             | ...                  |
