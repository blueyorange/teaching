# :blue_book: Do It Now :smiley:

1. :earth_africa: At the Earth's *South* *geographic* pole there is a ??? *magnetic* pole.
2. :magnet: When an _unmagnetised_ iron nail is placed next to a magnet it _becomes_ a magnet. This is called ??? magnetism.
3. :compass: To plot a magnetic field we can use a ??? compass.
4. :thinking: Can you name three devices at home that use an **electric motor**?

# Answers :+1:

1. :earth_africa: At the Earth's *South* *geographic* pole there is a **North** *magnetic* pole.
2. :magnet: When an _unmagnetised_ iron nail is placed next to a magnet it _becomes_ a magnet. This is called **induced** magnetism.
3. :compass: To plot a magnetic field we can use a **plotting** compass.
4. Washing machine, dishwasher, hairdryer, electric car, fan heater, extractor fan, heat pump.

## Learning Objectives

- _describe_ the **motor effect** and factors affecting it
- _apply_ the **left hand rule**
- _calculate_ using $F=BIL$

---

# What is the motor effect?

- we have seen that:
  - current-carrying wires have their own **magnetic field**
  - interacting **magnetic fields** can **attract** or **repel**

:question: What happens if we put a **current-carrying wire** in a **magnetic field?**

---

# The jumping wire

- A **current carrying wire** in a magnetic field experiences a force.
- The force is at **right angles** to the current and the magnetic field.

:question: will the wire jump up or down?
:question: what does the size of the force depend on?

# What does the size of the force depend on?

The force is proportional to...

- magnetic field strength (or **magnetic flux density**) (B)
- current (I)
- length of the wire in the field (L)

so force = magnetic field strength x current x length

$$F=BIL$$

---

# Summary

$F=BIl$ if the current $I$ and the field $B$ are at right angles to each other.

- $F$ Force in newtons (N)
- $B$ magnetic field strength in tesla (T)
- $I$ current in amperes (A)
- $l$ length of wire in field in metres (m)

![bg right:30% fit](https://i.stack.imgur.com/sWMRK.png)

The direction of the force $F$ is given by **Fleming's left hand rule** (above).
