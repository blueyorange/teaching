1. :earth_africa: At the Earth's *South* *geographic* pole there is a **North** *magnetic* pole.
2. :magnet: When an _unmagnetised_ iron nail is placed next to a magnet it _becomes_ a magnet. This is called **induced** magnetism.
3. :compass: To plot a magnetic field we can use a **plotting** compass.

# Magnetic flux density

- is the name for the **strength** of the magnetic field
- it is measured in **tesla** (T)
- it has the symbol **B**

# Magnetic flux density

:pen: copy and complete!

- **B** is the symbol for...
- It has units of...
- As you go further from a bar magnet, B **increases/decreases**

# The motor effect

> A wire carrying a **current** at **right angles** to a **magnetic field** experiences a **force**.

The size of the force depends on:
- the **magnetic flux density**
- the **current**

# The motor effect

:pen: A wire carrying a **current** at **right angles** to a **magnetic field** experiences a **force**. The size of the force depends on...

* magnetic flux density
* current
* angle between current and field

This is called the **motor effect**.

# Fleming's left hand rule

This tells us the **direction** of the force.

# The jumping wire

- A **current carrying wire** in a **magnetic field** experiences a force.
- The force is at **right angles** to the current and the magnetic field.
- The size of the force depends on
  - current
  - magnetic **flux density**
  - angle between current and field.

If the current and field are **parallel**, the force is **zero**.

# Worked Example

$$F=BIL$$

A 1 m wire carrying 0.5 A :arrow_right: in a magnetic field of 1 T **into the board** experiences a force.

What is the **size** and **direction** of the force?

---

# Spot the mistake!

$$F = BIL$$

A 1 m wire carrying 500 mA :arrow_right: in a magnetic field of 1 T **into the board :cross:** experiences a force.
What is the **size** and direction of the force?

## Solution?

$F = BIL = 500 \times 1 \times 1 = 500 N$

---

# Spot the mistake!

$$F = BIL$$

A 1 m wire carrying 500 mA :arrow_right: in a magnetic field of 1 T **into the board :cross:** experiences a force.
What is the **size** and direction of the force?

## Solution

$F = BIL = 0.5 \times 1 \times 1 = 0.5 N$

---

# Questions

1. Copy and complete the table.

| F / N | B / T | I / A | L / m |
|---|---|---|---|
| 12 | 

---

# What does the size of the force depend on?

$$F=BIL$$

The force is proportional to...

- magnetic field strength (or **magnetic flux density**) (B)
- current (I in amperes (A))
- length of the wire in the field (L)

so force = magnetic field strength x current x length

---

# Summary

$F=BIl$ if the current $I$ and the field $B$ are at right angles to each other.

- $F$ Force in newtons (N)
- $B$ magnetic field strength in tesla (T)
- $I$ current in amperes (A)
- $l$ length of wire in field in metres (m)

![bg right:20% fit](https://i.stack.imgur.com/sWMRK.png)

The direction of the force $F$ is given by **Fleming's left hand rule** (above).
