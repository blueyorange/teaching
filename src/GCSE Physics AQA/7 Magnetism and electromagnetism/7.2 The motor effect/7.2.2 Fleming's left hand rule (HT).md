## 7.2.2 The motor efect and Fleming's left hand rule (HT)

- the motor effect and factors affecting
- the left hand rule and how to apply it
- $F=BIL$

# Recall: the field around a long straight wire

![bg right](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Long-wire-right-hand-rule.svg)

- The wires on the left experience an **attractive** force
- Those on the right experience a **repulsive** force
- This force is usually very small

# Force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field

$F=BIl$ if the current $I$ and the field $B$ are at right angles to each other.

- $F$ Force in newtons (N)
- $B$ magnetic field strength in tesla (T)
- $I$ current in amperes (A)
- $l$ length of wire in field in metres (m)

The direction of the force $F$ is given by **Fleming's left hand rule** (above).
