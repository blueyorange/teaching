## 7.2.2 The motor efect and Fleming's left hand rule (HT)

- the motor effect and factors affecting
- the left hand rule and how to apply it
- $F=BIL$

---

# Starter

Draw the magnetic field around two wires with currents going
1. In the same direction.
2. In opposite directions.

What is the magnetic field like between both?

# Field around two wires: what will happen to both?

* The wires on the left experience an **attractive** force
* Those on the right experience a **repulsive** force
* This force is usually very small

# Force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field

$F=BIl$ if the current $I$ and the field $B$ are at right angles to each other.

- $F$ Force in newtons (N)
- $B$ magnetic field strength in tesla (T)
- $I$ current in amperes (A)
- $l$ length of wire in field in metres (m)

The direction of the force $F$ is given by **Fleming's left hand rule** (above).

# Motor effect: The dc motor

- the **coil** carries an electric current
- the **brushes** connect the moving coil to an electrical circuit
- the **split ring commutator** ensures that the current does not switch direction

## Describe how the loudspeaker produces a sound wave

- **current** creates a magnetic field (around the coil)
- interacts with the **permanent magnet field**
- producing a **force** causing the coil/cone to move
- when **direction** of the current reverses, the direction of the (resultant) force reverses
