## 7.2.3 Electric motors (HT) and loudspeakers (HT)

- _explain_ how the **force** on a **conductor** in a magnetic field causes the **rotation of the coil** in an electric motor.
- _explain_ how a moving-coil **loudspeaker** and **headphones** work.

# Questions

- On your diagram, draw and label
  - **field lines** with B
  - **force** arrows on opposite sides of coil F
  - split ring **commutator**
  - low friction graphite **brushes**
- Explain why the motor rotates **continuously**.
- List some ways to make the motor turn _faster_.
- Explain why there is **no force** on the far (top) and near (bottom) side of the coil.
- The left and right sides of the coil have a length of 5cm and a current of 1.5 A. They have a force of 0.25 N. Calculate the magnetic flux density.
- The coil has a width of 3cm. Calculate the **moment** of the coil.

# Factors to increase the rate of rotation of the dc motor

* increase the **current**
* increase the **magnetic flux density**
* increase the **number of turns**

---

# Explain why the motor rotates continuously

- the sides of the coil (parallel to the magnet) experience a **force** (in opposite directions)
- the forces cause **moments** that act in the same (clockwise / anticlockwise) direction
- the **moments** cause the coil to rotate (clockwise / anticlockwise)
- (each half-revolution) the two halves of the (rotating) **commutator** swap from one (carbon) brush to the other

# Describe how the loudspeaker produces a sound wave

- **current** creates a magnetic field (around the coil)
- interacts with the **permanent magnet field**
- producing a **force** causing the coil/cone to move
- when **direction** of the current reverses, the direction of the (resultant) force reverses
