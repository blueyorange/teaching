## 7.2.3 Electric motors (HT) and loudspeakers (HT)

- _explain_ how the **force** on a **conductor** in a magnetic field causes the **rotation of the coil** in an electric motor.
- _explain_ how a moving-coil **loudspeaker** and **headphones** work.

# The dc motor

- the **coil** carries an electric current
- the **brushes** connect the moving coil to an electrical circuit
- the **split ring commutator** ensures that the current does not switch direction and the motor turns freely

# Factors to increase the rate of rotation of the dc motor

- increase the **current**
- increase the **magnetic flux density**
- increase the **number of turns**

# When there is a current in the coil, the coil rotates continuously.

## Explain why. Put the sentences in the same order.

- (each half-revolution) the two halves of the (rotating) commutator swap from one (carbon) brush to the other
- (each half-revolution) the two halves of the (rotating) commutator swap from one (carbon) brush to the other
- the forces cause **moments** that act in the same (clockwise / anticlockwise) direction
- the **moments** cause the coil to rotate (clockwise / anticlockwise)
- the sides of the coil (parallel to the magnet) experience a **force** (in opposite directions)

## Describe how the loudspeaker produces a sound wave

- **current** creates a magnetic field (around the coil)
- interacts with the **permanent magnet field**
- producing a **force** causing the coil/cone to move
- when **direction** of the current reverses, the direction of the (resultant) force reverses
