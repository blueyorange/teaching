# 7 Magnetism and electromagnetism

## 7.3 Induced potential, transformers, National Grid

### 7.3.1 Induced potential (HT)

# :blue_book: Do It Now! :sunglasses:

1. What makes a current flow?
2. What is the unit of electrical potential difference?
3. A current in a solenoid flows anticlockwise, as you look at it. Which way do the field lines point? (towards you or away from you)
4. Is this a North or South pole?
5. What is **induced** magnetism?

## 7.3.1 Induced potential (HT)

- factors that affect the size of the induced potential difference/induced current.
- factors that affect the direction of the induced potential difference/induced current.
- apply the principles of the generator effect in a given context.

# Electromagnetic induction

- discovered by Michael Faraday, 1831
- underpins electrical **generator** and **transformer**
- without this our society would not be possible!

# Recall: electricity

A current :zap: requires two things to flow:
- a closed circuit
- a potential difference :battery:

Potential difference is measured in **volts**.

# Induced potential in a wire

If a wire is moved through a magnetic field such that **lines of magnetic flux are cut**, a potential is induced in the wire.

The effect can be increased by:
- moving the wire more quickly
- using a stronger magnet

---

# Induced potential in a coil

An induced potential :zap: can be generated in two ways:
- move a **magnet** :magnet: relative to a coil
- move the **coil** relative to a magnet

The effect can be increased by:
- increasing the **number of turns** on the coil
- using a **stronger magnet**
- moving the coil/magnet **more quickly**

---

# Changing the direction
The **direction** is reversed when:

- the magnet is moved in the opposite direction
- the opposite pole is moved in (magnetic field reversed)

The direction of the magnetic field always acts to **oppose** the change which caused it (Lenz's law).

# Task

Use the PhET simulation 'faraday' (search for PhET Faraday). Play with the simulation for five minutes to see what you can find out.
