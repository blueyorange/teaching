<!-- _class: phet -->

# Starter

## The **motor effect** states that a current in a magnetic field experiences a **force**. Is the reverse true?

## 7.3.1 Induced potential (HT)

- factors that affect the size of the induced potential difference/induced current.
- factors that affect the direction of the induced potential difference/induced current.
- apply the principles of the generator effect in a given context.

# Investigate

## Use the PhET simulation 'faraday' (search for PhET Faraday). Play with the simulation for five minutes to see what you can find out.

# Investigate

How can you...

- increase the size of the induced potential (voltage)
- change the direction of the induced potential?

---

# Electromagnetic induction

- When a coil of wire is moved in a magnetic field, an **induced potential** (voltage) is generated. The **magnitude** depends on:
  - the number of turns of wire
  - the magnetic field strength (**flux density**)
  - the speed of movement

The **induced potential** is proportional to the **rate of cutting of magnetic flux**.

---

# Electromagnetic induction

- the **direction** is reversed when:
  - the magnet is moved in the opposite direction
  - the opposite pole is moved in (magnetic field reversed)

The direction of the magnetic field always acts to **oppose** the change which caused it - work must be done against the magnetic field.

## 7.3.2 Uses of the generator effect

- explain how the generator effect is used in an alternator to generate ac and in a dynamo to generate dc
- draw/interpret graphs of potential difference generated in the coil against time

---

# Bicycle dynamo

- a dynamo converts **kinetic energy** into electrical energy
- it creates a direct current (**dc**)
- a bicycle dynamo can be used to power a light

# Task

Use the textbook to compare the **alternator** and the **dynamo**.

Create a table or Venn diagram to illustrate the similarities and differences.
