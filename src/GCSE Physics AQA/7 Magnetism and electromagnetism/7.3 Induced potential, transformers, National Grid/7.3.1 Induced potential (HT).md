# :blue_book: Do It Now!

1. What is the unit of magnetic flux density?
2. What is the symbol for magnetic flux density?
3. What is the symbol for 'potential difference'?
4. What is the unit of potential difference?
5. You look at the end of a solenoid where the current direction is anticlockwise. Which way do the field lines point? (a) towards you (b) away from you.
6. What is 'induced magnetism'?

## 7.3.1 Induced potential (HT)

- factors that affect the size of the induced potential difference/induced current.
- factors that affect the direction of the induced potential difference/induced current.
- apply the principles of the generator effect in a given context.

# Recall: potential and potential difference

In the electricity topic you learned that two things are needed for an **electric current** :zap: to flow:

1. a complete circuit
2. a potential difference (voltage)

Often, potential difference is provided by a cell, or battery :battery:.

# Electromagnetic induction

- Michael Faraday, 1831
- basis of **electrical generator** and **transformer**
- basis for our modern electrical society!

# Induced potential

Potential difference can be created two other ways:

1. A magnet :magnet: is moved into a coil of wire.
2. A coil of wire is moved relative to a magnet :magnet:.

# Increasing the effect

The induced potential can be increased if we:

- move the magnet more quickly
- increase the number of turns on the coil
- use a stronger magnet

---

# Changing the direction

The **direction** is reversed when:

- the magnet is moved in the opposite direction
- the opposite pole is moved in (magnetic field reversed)

The direction of the magnetic field always acts to **oppose** the change which caused it (Lenz's law).

## 7.3.2 Uses of the generator effect

- explain how the generator effect is used in an alternator to generate ac and in a dynamo to generate dc
- draw/interpret graphs of potential difference generated in the coil against time
