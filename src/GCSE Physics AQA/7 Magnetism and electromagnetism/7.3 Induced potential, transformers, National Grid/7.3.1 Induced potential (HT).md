# Starter

## The **motor effect** states that a current in a magnetic field experiences a **force**. Is the reverse true?

## 7.3.1 Induced potential (HT)

- factors that affect the size of the induced potential difference/induced current.
- factors that affect the direction of the induced potential difference/induced current.
- apply the principles of the generator effect in a given context.

# Investigate

## Use the PhET simulation 'faraday' (search for PhET Faraday). Play with the simulation for five minutes to see what you can find out.

# Increasing the effect

The induced potential can be increased if we:

- move the magnet more quickly
- increase the number of turns on the coil
- use a stronger magnet

---

# Changing the direction

The **direction** is reversed when:

- the magnet is moved in the opposite direction
- the opposite pole is moved in (magnetic field reversed)

The direction of the magnetic field always acts to **oppose** the change which caused it (Lenz's law).

## 7.3.2 Uses of the generator effect

- explain how the generator effect is used in an alternator to generate ac and in a dynamo to generate dc
- draw/interpret graphs of potential difference generated in the coil against time
