# 7 Magnetism and electromagnetism

## 7.3 Induced potential, transformers, National Grid

### 7.3.2 uses of the generator effect

# :blue_book: Do It Now! :sunglasses:

1. What makes a current flow?
2. What is the unit of electrical potential difference?
3. A current in a solenoid flows anticlockwise, as you look at it. Which way do the field lines point? (towards you or away from you)
4. Is this a North or South pole?
5. What is **induced** magnetism?

## 7.3.2 uses of the generator effect

- explain how the generator effect is used in an alternator to generate ac and in a dynamo to generate dc
- draw/interpret graphs of potential difference generated in the coil against time

---

# Bicycle dynamo

- a dynamo converts **kinetic energy** into electrical energy
- it creates a direct current (**dc**)
- a bicycle dynamo can be used to power a light
