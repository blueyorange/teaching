## 7.3.4 Transformers

- structure and uses of a transformer
>>>>>>> 6cba0ac (c)
- $\frac{V_p}{V_s} = \frac{N_p}{N_s}$
- $V_sI_s = V_pI_p$

# What do transformers do?

- used to **step up** or **step down** voltage
- this helps electricity transmission to be more **efficient**

# The National Grid

# The National Grid

- Voltage is **stepped up** at the generating station...
- ...is **transmitted** at high voltage/low current...
- ...to reduce **resistance heating**...
- and is then **stepped down** at the consumer end

# The National Grid

Electricity is **generated** at power stations. It is stepped ... at the generating end. It is transmitted at high ... and low ... . This reduces .... in the power cables and results in less energy loss. The voltage is stepped ... at the consumer end, so that it is safe to use.

# Recall: Faraday's Law

> _The induced potential is proportional to the rate of cutting of magnetic flux_.

# The Transformer

- two coils with **no electrical connection**
- both carry an **alternating current**
- potential is **induced** in secondary coil
- due to a **changing magnetic flux**

# Write the sentences in the **correct order**

- There is a changing magnetic flux through the secondary coil
- Alternating current flows through the primary coil
- A changing magnetic field is induced in the iron core
- A potential is induced in the secondary coil
- A current flows in the secondary coil

---

# Solution

1. Alternating current flows through the primary coil
2. A changing magnetic field is induced in the iron core
3. There is a changing magnetic flux through the secondary coil
4. A potential is induced in the secondary coil
5. A current flows in the secondary coil
