# :blue_book: Do It Now! :sunglasses:

1. State the unit of magnetic flux density.
2. A wire 2 cm long is carrying 2 amps of current is placed parallel to magnetic field lines of 0.3 T. State the force on the wire.
3. The same wire is placed at 90 degrees to the field lines. Calculate the force on the wire.
4. A solenoid connected to an ammeter. A magnet is pushed into and out of the coil. State what is observed on the ammeter.
5. As the magnet is pushed in, there is a repulsive force on it. Why?

# Recall: induced potential

A potential is induced in a solenoid if there is a **changing magnetic flux** through the selonoid.

- **But** we don't have to **move** the magnet!
- What if we use a stationary coil, with a _changing_ magnetic field?
- This is the basis of the **transformer**

# What is the job of a transformer?

- a transformer is used to _step up_ and _step down_ **potential difference (voltage)**
- electricity is **transmitted** at high voltage, as it is more _efficient_

# Transformers

All transformers require **alternating current** to work!

- primary coil with $N_p$ turns
- secondary coil with $N_s$ turns
- iron core

n.b. There is **no electrical connection** between the primary and secondary coils!

# Investigating transformers

Use the simulation **Faraday's lab** to explore the transformer (choose the correct tab!)

- Describe in what ways you can make the secondary coil light up.
- Explain why the following cause an induced potential on the secondary coil:
  - a moving primary coil with **direct current**
  - a stationary primary coil with **alternating current**
- Describe in what ways you can make the induced potential *greater*.

# The maths bit: turns and voltages

$$\frac{V_p}{V_s} = \frac{N_p}{N_s}$$

The ratio between primary and secondary voltage is _equal_ to the ratio between number of turns on both.

### Worked Example
A transformer has 230 V ac, 400 turns on the primary coil, and 200 turns on the secondary coil.
Calculate the secondary voltage.

---

# The maths bit, pt 2: electrical energy

Transformers are often close to _100% efficient_.

So, the power on the secondary coil is equal to the power on the primary coil.
**Recall**: power = current (I) x voltage (V)

$$\begin{align}
P_p &= P_s \\
I_pV_p &= I_sV_s\\
\end{align}
$$

So, in a step-up transformer, what happens to
- voltage?
- current?
