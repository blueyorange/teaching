# Do It Now! :blue_book:

1. What is the 7th planet from the Sun?
2. What sort of object is Ceres?
3. Between which two planets is the asteroid belt?
4. You look up into the night sky and see a bright object. The next night, it is in a slightly different position. What is it?
5. What is the name of our own galaxy?

## 8.1.2 The life cycle of a star

- describe the life cycle of a star:
  - the size of the Sun
  - much more massive than the Sun

# Nebula

- "Pillars of creation", Eagle Nebula
- Giant clouds of gas and dust
- They **absorb** and **re-emit** light from other stars

---

# Protostar

![bg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Protostar_Herbig-Haro_46_47.jpg?20050923111652)

- Core of high pressure and temperature gas
- Gives out light
- Does not yet burn from **nuclear fusion**

---

# Main sequence

- **nuclear fusion** becomes dominant mode of energy production
- star increases in **size**
- our **Sun** is a main sequence star

# Red giant / red supergiant

- _Betelgeuse_, 642.5 light years from Earth (red supergiant star)
- Hydrogen in core has run out - core collapses
- Star begins to fuse helium
- star increases in size _massively_
- helium fusion occurs, generating elements up to lead

# White dwarf

- Fate of 97% of stars
- Red giant outer layer cools and is lost to space
- Core remains as a hot, bright star

---

# Supernova and Neutron star

![bg opacity:0.7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Moving_heart_of_the_Crab_Nebula.jpg)

The _Crab nebula_ (supernova, 1054 AD).

- A very red giant explodes - _supernova_
- After supernova, a neutron star remains
- Happens to stars with between 10 and 25 solar masses
- _Incredibly_ dense
- all elements heavier than lead were produced this way!

# Black hole

_Messier 87_ supermassive black hole.

- Stars > 25 solar masses
- Gravity collapses star to a point
- Gravity so strong, light cannot escape!

---

# How can we see black holes?

![bg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Black_hole_lensing_web.gif)

We see their effect on other things.
This is _gravitational lensing_.

# Task

Create a poster summarising the life cycle of a star.

It should show:

- How stars form
- what happens to lighter stars
- what happens to very massive stars
