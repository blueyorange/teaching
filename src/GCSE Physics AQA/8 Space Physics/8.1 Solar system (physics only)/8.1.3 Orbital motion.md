## 8.1 Solar system; stability of orbital motions; satellites (physics only)

### 8.1.3 Orbital motion

## 8.1.3 Orbital motion

- gravity as force which keeps objects in orbit
- (HT only) for circular orbits, the force of gravity can lead to changing velocity but unchanged speed
- (HT only) for a stable orbit, the radius must change if the speed changes.

# There is no gravity in space

Is this correct?
