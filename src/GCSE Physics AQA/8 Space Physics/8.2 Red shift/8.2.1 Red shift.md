## 8.2.1 Red shift

- explain qualitatively the red-shift of light from galaxies that are receding
- that the change of each galaxyâ€™s speed with distance is evidence of an expanding universe
- how red-shift provides evidence for the Big Bang model
- how scientists are able to use observations to arrive at theories such as the Big Bang theory
- that there is still much about the universe that is not understood, for example dark mass and dark energy.

## Hubble increased the size of the observable universe by a **million** times!

<!-- - Before Hubble, the Universe was 100,000 light years across
- After Hubble, the Universe became 97 billion light years! -->

- Light from stars has a 'fingerprint'
- As the Universe expands, the light wave is **stretched**

# Have you ever heard an ambulance go past?

## How does the sound change?

# The big bang

- Using redshift, Hubble found that the **further** the galaxy is, the **faster** it is moving
- This implies an **explosion**
- To see why, lets make a model!

---

# Problems with the people model

- There is a 'center' to the explosion

## There is no center to the Universe. Every galaxy moves away from every other.

# The balloon model

- Draw three dots on the surface of the balloon ABC such that the distance from A to C is about twice the distance from A to B.
- Record the distances
- Blow the balloon up a little more
- Record the distances again.
- What do you notice?
