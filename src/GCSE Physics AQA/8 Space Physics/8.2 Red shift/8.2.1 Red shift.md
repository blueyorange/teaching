## 8.2.1 Red shift

- explain qualitatively the red-shift of light from galaxies that are receding
- that the change of each galaxyâ€™s speed with distance is evidence of an expanding universe
- how red-shift provides evidence for the Big Bang model
- how scientists are able to use observations to arrive at theories such as the Big Bang theory
- that there is still much about the universe that is not understood, for example dark mass and dark energy.

# The Milky Way

## What is it?

## How big is it?

## How big is the Universe?

# Edwin Hubble

## Hubble increased the size of the observable universe by a **million** times!

<!-- - Before Hubble, the Universe was 100,000 light years across
- After Hubble, the Universe became 97 billion light years! -->

# Red shift

![bg right fit](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Redshift.svg/1200px-Redshift.svg.png)

- Light from stars has a 'fingerprint' (line spectrum)
- As the Universe expands, the light wave is **stretched**
- The wavelength **increases**
- This makes white light appear more red - hence **redshift**

# Have you ever heard an ambulance go past?

## How does the sound change?

# The big bang

- Using redshift, Hubble found that the **further** the galaxy is, the **faster** it is moving
- This implies an **explosion**
- The **Big Bang** is the name for the idea that the Universe began in an explosion
- It explains why the Universe is expanding

---

# Problems with the people model

- There is a 'center' to the explosion

## There is no center to the Universe. Every galaxy moves away from every other.

# The balloon model

- Draw three dots on the surface of the balloon ABC such that the distance from A to C is about twice the distance from A to B.
- Record the distances
- Blow the balloon up a little more
- Record the distances again.
- What do you notice?

---

# Meanwhile...

- Einstein found that the Universe must be either **expanding** or **contracting** according to General Relativity
- He didn't believe this at first until he saw Hubble's redshift data

# The steady state theory (non-examinable)

- Some scientists did not like the Big Bang theory
- Fred Hoyle proposed that new matter is created as the Universe expands, thereby keeping the density of the Universe constant
- This was called the _steady state_ theory
- **We no longer believe this to be true**

# Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation

- Radiation 'left over' from shortly after the Big Bang
- Exactly fits with predictions
- Very strong evidence for the Big Bang

<!-- Cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) is a type of electromagnetic radiation that permeates the entire universe and is believed to have originated shortly after the Big Bang.
It is essentially a snapshot of the universe at a time when it was only about 380,000 years old, and it is incredibly uniform in all directions, with only very slight variations in temperature and density.
The CMB has been studied extensively by scientists, and it has provided a wealth of information about the early universe, including the age, composition, and expansion rate of the universe. -->

# Summary

- Hubble discovered that the Universe is **much bigger** than people thought
- Redshift is the tendency for light to appear more red for objects, like galaxies, that are moving away from us very quickly
- The further the galaxy, the faster it moves
- The Universe began in an explosion called the **Big Bang**
