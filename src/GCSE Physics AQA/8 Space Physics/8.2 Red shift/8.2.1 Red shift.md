## 8.2.1 Red shift


- explain qualitatively the red-shift of light from galaxies that are receding
- that the change of each galaxyâ€™s speed with distance is evidence of an expanding universe
- how red-shift provides evidence for the Big Bang model
- how scientists are able to use observations to arrive at theories such as the Big Bang theory
- that there is still much about the universe that is not understood, for example dark mass and dark energy.
