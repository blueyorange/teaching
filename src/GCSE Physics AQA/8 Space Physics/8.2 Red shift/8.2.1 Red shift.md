## 8.2.1 Red shift

- explain qualitatively the **red-shift** of light from galaxies that are receding
- that the change of each galaxyâ€™s speed with distance is evidence of an **expanding universe**
- how red-shift provides **evidence** for the Big Bang model
- how scientists are able to use **observations** to arrive at **theories** such as the Big Bang theory
- that there is still much about the universe that is not understood, for example **dark mass** and **dark energy**.

# Measuring distance from light

All we know about the Universe, we know from looking at the night sky.

- If we look at a distant candle, can we work out how far away it is?

# Henrietta Leavitt

![bg right](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Leavitt_aavso.jpg)

- Discovered the first **standard candles**
- Cepheid variable stars
- The first step in measuring the distances across the Universe

# Edwin Hubble

<!-- - Before Hubble, the Universe was 100,000 light years across
- After Hubble, the Universe became 97 billion light years! -->

# Investigating galaxies

Hubble built on the work of Leavitt. He found that

- there are **galaxies** outside the Milky Way
- the **Universe** is a **lot bigger** than we thought
- the further **away** galaxies are, the **faster** they are moving.

It follows from the last point that the universe is **expanding**, and that it therefore began in an explosion we call the **big bang**.

# Red shift

![bg right fit](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Redshift.svg/1200px-Redshift.svg.png)

- Light from stars has a 'fingerprint' (line spectrum)
- As the Universe expands, the light wave is **stretched**
- The wavelength **increases**
- This makes white light appear _more_ red - hence **redshift**

---

# The Doppler Effect

- waves from an object moving **towards** you appear to have a **shorter wavelength**
- waves from an object moving **away** from you appear to have a **longer wavelength**

# The big bang

- Using redshift, Hubble found that the **further** the galaxy is, the **faster** it is moving
- This implies an **explosion**
- The **Big Bang** is the name for the idea that the Universe began in an explosion
- It explains why the Universe is expanding

---

# Problems with the people model

- There is a 'center' to the explosion

There is no center to the Universe. Every galaxy moves away from every other.

# The balloon model

- Draw three dots on the surface of the balloon ABC such that the distance from A to C is about twice the distance from A to B.
- Record the distances
- Blow the balloon up a little more
- Record the distances again.
- What do you notice?

---

# The steady state theory

_non-examinable_

- Some scientists did not like the Big Bang theory
- _Fred Hoyle_ explained the findings by sating that the Universe is expanding, but matter is being continuously created between galaxies.
- This was called the _steady state_ theory
- **We no longer believe this to be true**

# Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation

- Radiation 'left over' from shortly after the Big Bang
- Exactly fits with predictions
- Very strong evidence for the Big Bang

![bg right fit](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Ilc_9yr_moll4096.png/800px-Ilc_9yr_moll4096.png)

<!-- Cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) is a type of electromagnetic radiation that permeates the entire universe and is believed to have originated shortly after the Big Bang.
It is essentially a snapshot of the universe at a time when it was only about 380,000 years old, and it is incredibly uniform in all directions, with only very slight variations in temperature and density.
The CMB has been studied extensively by scientists, and it has provided a wealth of information about the early universe, including the age, composition, and expansion rate of the universe. -->

# Dark matter

# Task - presentation

Prepare a 2-4 minute presentation on one of the following topics:

1. The doppler effect and red shift.
2. The Hubble law and the hubble constant.
3. The cosmic microwave background radiation.
4. Dark matter/dark energy and how ideas have changed.
5. Measuring distance across the Universe (two methods).

It should contain no more than 5 slides, containing either **one image** or **minimal, bulletpointed text**, to be presented **next lesson**. You _should_ work in pairs.

---

# Summary

- Hubble discovered that the Universe is **much bigger** than people thought
- Redshift is the tendency for light to appear more red for objects, like galaxies, that are moving away from us very quickly
- The further the galaxy, the faster it moves
- The Universe began in an explosion called the **Big Bang**
