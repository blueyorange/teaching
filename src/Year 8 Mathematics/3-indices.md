# :orange_book: Do it now please! :+1:

Evaluate fully.

1. $\frac{2^6}{2^5} = 2$
2. $(9^3)^3 = 9^9=387,420,489$
3. $\frac{4^3 \times 4^5}{4^4} = 4^4=256$
4. $4^2 = 2^n$. What is $n$? $n=4$
5. $\frac{2^2}{2^3} = \frac{1}{2}$

# Laws of Indices

## Learning Objectives :eye:

- :white_check_mark: recall how to use **index notation**
- :white_check_mark: **multiply** and **divide numbers** with indices
- :white_check_mark: use the **zero index**
- :white_check_mark: raise a **power** to a further power
- :x: use **negative** and **fractional** indices

### What can you tell me about this?

$$\frac{5^2}{5^3}$$
think :thinking: pair :couple: share :handshake:
Use your :memo: to do working out!

# Negative indices

$$\frac{5^2}{5^3} = 5^{-1} = \frac{1}{5}$$

A **negative index** means take one over the answer.

# Example

## $15^{-1} = \frac{1}{15}$

---

# :memo: $12^{-1}$ = :question:

---

# :memo: $12^{-1} = \frac{1}{12}$ :smiley:

---

# :memo: $(2^4)^{-1}=$ :question:

---

# :memo: $(2^4)^{-1}=2^{-3}=\frac{1}{8}$ :sunglasses:

# :memo: $3^{-1} \times 3^{3}=$ :question:

---

# :memo: $3^{-1} \times 3^{3}= 3^2=9$ :exploding_head:

# Tarsia puzzle

In pairs :couple:

- Cut out each triangle.
- Start with **green**.
- Make a hexagon by matching up the edges so that they are **equal**.

---

# Fractional Indices

A fractional index means a **root**.

For example, $16^{1/2} = \sqrt{16} = 4$

#### Raising to the power of $1/2$ means **take the square root**. :exploding_head:

---

# More fractional indices

Raising to the power of $1/3$ means find the **cube root**.

For example $125^{\frac{1}{3}} = \sqrt[3]{125} = 5$
