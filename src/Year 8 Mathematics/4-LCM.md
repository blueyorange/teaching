# Learning Objectives :eye:

- review
  - primes
  - factors
  - multiples
- express a number as a product of its prime factors
- use Venn diagrams to find **highest common factor**s (HCFs) and **lowest common multiple**s (LCMs)

# Factors

The factors of 24 are 24, 12, 8, 6, 3, 2, and 1.

Each factor divides into 24 *exactly*.

:memo: Write down the factors of 15.

# Factors of 15

Did you get them all?

15, 5, 3, and 1. :sunglasses:

If not, which ones did you miss out?

# Factors of 20
## 20, 10, 5, 2, and 1

# Prime numbers

A number is prime if it has only two **factors**: itself, and 1.

## Example
- 5 is prime because it is only divisible by itself and 1.
- 15 is not prime as it has 3 and 5 as factors.

# There are :infinity:ly many prime numbers!

The largest known prime number is $2^{82,589,933}-1$.

Written out, it would have 24,862,048 digits! :exploding_head:
