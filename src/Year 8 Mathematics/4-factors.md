#### 19th September 2023

1. What is $(y^3)^{-2}$
2. What is $(\frac{1}{9})^{-1}$
3. What is $y^3 \times y^5 \times y^2$?
4. What numbers divide into 24 exactly (with no remainder)?
5. Give an example of a **prime** number.
6. Give an example of a number which is _not_ **prime**.

# Learning Objectives :eye:

- review
  - primes
  - factors
  - multiples
- express a number as a product of its prime factors
- use Venn diagrams to find **highest common factor**s (HCFs) and **lowest common multiple**s (LCMs)

# Factors

The factors of 24 are 24, 12, 8, 6, 3, 2, and 1.

Each factor divides into 24 _exactly_.

:memo: Write down the factors of 15.

# Factors of 15

Did you get them all?

15, 5, 3, and 1. :sunglasses:

If not, which ones did you miss out?

# :memo: factors of 20 :question:

# Factors of 20

## 20, 10, 5, 2, and 1

---

# Prime numbers

A number is prime if it has only two **factors**: itself, and 1.

## Example

- 5 is prime because it is only divisible by itself and 1.
- 15 is not prime as it has 3 and 5 as factors.

---

# There are :infinity:ly many prime numbers!

The largest known prime number is $2^{82,589,933}-1$.

Written out, it would have 24,862,048 digits! :exploding_head:

# Why are prime numbers important?

- primes make up all numbers (you shouldn't trust them :laughing:)
- they are very important in **encryption** (why you can go shopping :shopping: on the internet safely)
