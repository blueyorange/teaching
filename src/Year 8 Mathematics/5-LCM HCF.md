# :orange_book: Do It Now (please) :smiley:

1. What is $(x^4)^2$?
2. What are the first 3 **multiple** of 9?
3. What are the **factors** of 9?
4. Which of these are **prime**?
5. What are the **factors** of 6?
6. What are the **common factors** of 6 and 9?
7. What is the **highest common factor** of 6 and 9?
8. What is the **lowest common multiple** of 6 and 9?

# Learning Objectives :eye:

- LCF and HCM
- Common factors and Venn diagrams
- Finding the HCF and LCM from a Venn diagram

---

# Highest common factor

## Factors of 9: **1,3**,9

## Factors of 6: **1,3**,6

The **common factors** are 1,3.
So the **highest** common factor is 3.

# :memo: What is the HCF of 9 and 21 :question:

---

# :memo: The HCF of 9 and 21 is 3 :sunglasses:

---

# :memo: What is the HCF of 8 and 6 :question:

---

# :memo: The HCF of 8 and 6 is 2 :clap:

---

# :memo: What is the HCF of 24 and 8 :question:

# Lowest common multiple LCM

Not to be confused with LGM :alien:

### Multiples of 10: 10,20,**30**,40,50,**60**

### Multiples of 15: 15,**30**,45,**60**

so the **lowest** common multiple (LCM) is **30**.

## Using Venn diagrams to find the LCM and HCF

1. Find the prime factors (factor tree)?
2. LCM is the **product of all prime factors**.
3. Draw a Venn diagram.
4. Common factors in the **intersection**.
5. HCF is the product of the **common factors**.

### :green_circle: Exercise

- Write down all the factors of
  - 44
  - 54
  - 29
- "All multiples of 9 are multiples of 3'. True or false? Explain.
- Find the factors of 24 and 40, and hence the HCF.
- Write down the LCM of 12 and 25.
- John has 18 apples and 24 oranges. He wants to pack them into boxes with an equal number of fruits. What is the greatest number of fruits that he can put in each box? What have you found?

### :green_circle: Answers

- Factors
  - 1,2,4,11,22,44
  - 1,2,3,6,9,18,27,54
  - 1,29
- Yes because 9 is a multiple of 3. Multiples of 9 are $9n$, multiples of 3 are $3m$ with $m=3n$, $n=1,2,3,4...$
- Common factors: 1,2,4,8. HCF is 8.
- 12 and 25 HCF is 1 so LCM is $12 \times 25=300$.
- It's the HCF of 18 and 24: 6.
