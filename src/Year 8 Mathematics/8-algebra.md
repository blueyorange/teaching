# Learning Objectives

- collect like terms
- use letters for numbers

# Collecting like terms

Luke has 3 apples and 4 oranges.

3:apple: + 4:orange:

Abbie has 5 apples and 2 oranges.

5:apple: + 2:orange:

How many do they both have together?

---

# Collecting like terms

3:apple: + 4:orange: + 5:apple: + 2:orange:

= 8:apple:+6:orange:

We could use letters instead:

3a + 4o + 5a + 2o
= 8a + 6o

---

# Using letters for numbers

Luke and Abbie have 8a + 6o.

An :apple: costs £0.50
An :orange: costs £0.70

How much did they spend, in total?
