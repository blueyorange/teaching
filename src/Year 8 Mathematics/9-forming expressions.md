# :memo: Do It Now!

- Make up one starter question, from the work we have done so far this term.
- Write it on your mini-whiteboard LARGE.
- Write the answer on the back LARGE.

**indices, prime factors, algebra**

# Example
### Write an expression for

### :memo: multiply n by 3, add 1, then multiply by 2
 
$$4(3n+1)$$

---

## :memo: multiply n by 5 and add 3

---

# :memo: add 1 to n then multiply by 4

<!-- _class: nested-questions -->

# :green_circle: Questions

- Write an expression for each
  - start with n, multiply by 5 and add x
  - start with x, multiply by 6 then subtract 3
  - start with y, add 3 then multiply by 4

---

# Over to you

- try some from Q1 and 2
- if too easy, move to Q3 to try the harder word problems.
